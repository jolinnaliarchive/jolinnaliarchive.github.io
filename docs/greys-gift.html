that could be felt by Grey spun itself into thread, which shewould parse through using her fingers and try to make sense of, but,like a mortal attempting to cipher the threads of fates, never was shesuccessful. Ring! The telephone invaded her thoughts, but as Greyreached for the receiver, she remembered that she had yet to go to thepost office, where it should be! A package — heavy and wrapped withthick yellow paper and a little tightening of twine — she could hear itssolid, crumpling sound as she opened it. And the bright feeling she wasbound to board and soar on when the sight of the gift entered her eyes!But alas, the voice of the phone spoke:</p><p>“Courtney, how are you, I have been thinking of you, but somethinghas prevented me from calling you…” her mother rambled as Grey beganrolling a thin strip of paper that was lying limp on her desk into atight spiral. Her mother’s voice, a soft, weak siren, came in and out ofits deep waters, and Courtney began her journey to the post office. Shecould picture the blue of the sky, and from her mind’s eye, Grey couldsee two people wearing bright yellow jackets. How serendipitous?! Thattwo unrelated people would head out their doors from different cornersof the city with the same piercing shade painted on their backs. Theevent pleased her, and it made Grey wonder about the odds of her life,and the odds of the giver of her gift. A strong inflection in the stillwaters of her mother’s incantations drew her back, pulling Grey’sopinionated chin from the window to the curvature of the receiver.</p><p>“Oh Court! You really should’ve married him when you had the chance.Anne is going to have another baby, and Louis is the best of fathers,”she said.</p><p>Grey always thought her mother talked in a rather wasteful way —Edwina Moore threw words carelessly and strung them together with propersyntax and impeccable drama, but failed to find a majestical spine thatwould connect a beast’s appendages, into something meaningful…worthwhile. And so it lay limp around her, pieces to revel at,dismembered and bloody. A day thirty years ago shot through Grey’s mind.Grey — Courtney rather, yes she was Courtney then — would stand at theedge of the tulip bed, as her mother would fret and spin around her,like a wild panther, while her words confusingly clawed at her. Eitherher dress was not spotless, or she spoke too loudly at supper, or herFrench was not up to the tastes of the other Edwinas of society. Greylet these memories pass, but the indignance they once held left a tremorin her small heart.</p><p>“I do believe I have quite a few errands to run,” Grey started. Likea hawk she tried to find a point where she could exit, to dive away, toget back to the steady ground of her life. <i>Wasn’t the notion insane?One’s own life. How could you own something that you had no businesspurchasing at the market.</i>  </p><p>“But I’ve barely just spoken to you, and I have not told you whatthey were saying about you today when I went to the department storeyesterday,” Mrs. Moore protested.</p><p>Grey sighed, the paper that she had been rolling had wasted away intoa thin string of fibre, and she could feel the pattern of its motion onher fingertips. Her sigh must have been extraordinarily audible, becauseEdwina Moore began again in a sharper tone. Grey could see her browncurls, once tinted with red, now with grey, but still glistening withthe resilience of the wife of a parliamentarian. They shone towards herwith a blinding light, and Grey squeezed her eyelids together as hermother’s phantom wrapped around her head.</p><p>“Courtney, I do not care about your errands, I am actually callingyou because of your concerning disposition, and as your mother I deserveat least that,” said Edwina Moore. “Please tell me you have at leastmade yourself useful this past summer, Mrs. Lowe told me you had stoppedgoing to the charity dinners on Sunday.”</p><p>Grey assured her mother that all was well, that her head had beenbothering her, that everything but the monkey in her that makesdecisions had been plotting against her. Her mother accepted her excusesone by one like a boy holding out a basket to an apple-picker. The callwas finished — at last — Grey leapt out into the summer air like asalmon bounding upstream.</p><p>Eyes, in all shades of possible plumage: green, sapphire, the deepestshade of brown, hid under neatly arranged sun caps and umbrellas. Greywas one for peering, and she did. Oh dear! Did anyone look at her? Shewanted it, others’ eyes, and yet she did not know what she would do withthem, other than take them to the ocean to watch the waves lap back andforth, and throw them into the soft dunes. What was she? A grain ofsand? She did feel rather granular as the sun began its descent,pixelating details, shrinking her down, making her a point, a bee in afield, a boat in a bay. It was a bearable feeling, this shrinking, butit was also unequally unbearable  — she was devastated. She wantedexpansion, to grow big and devour and take from the world. Her chesttightened and constricted. <i>Not now!</i> <i>Look around you!</i> Lookat the children, the dogs, the splendour of flowers spilling inabundance.</p><p>These risings and lowerings came over her whenever she headed to thepost office. A bashful encounter, a triumphant day of errands, anangering conversation beneath polite words, they flitted through herlike endless jolts of waves washing up and over, drawing in, drawingback, towards Rome and then out to the horizon.</p><p>But what was the use of these wonderings when she was about toreceive her gift? It was from Joanne. Joanne, the star in her night sky,the Joanne whose lips were always painted red. “I love you,” she hadsaid with those lips one night. Like a spell, those words have governedGrey’s life from the moment they spilt into the world. But Joanne wasnot here, she was in the painful “there”, a place Grey could onlyunderstand but could only touch when she unravelled the brown parcelsshe was sacredly allotted. <i>Was that enough</i>, Grey often wondered.Yes! She shouted it from rooftops. No! She thought to herself one latenight pouring herself a cup of warm milk in the kitchen. To be held,that was too much one could ask for! And yet it was also all she hadever wanted.</p><p>Grey’s shoes hit the pavement like beats from a metronome. She couldfeel it — Paris, Joanne’s home — getting closer. The summers she wouldspend there “studying art”, swinging from one cafe to another wrapped inher mother’s silks. Grey swore she could hear those dense afternoonsunder the sun, as the heat of it all exploded into storms around 4o’clock, just to be brought up again into a frenzy by night bugs andtheir orchestral melodies.</p><p>There stood the post office, on stout legs of brick, sporting a pairof dashing white windows looking out onto the busy street. Grey likedits posture, how neat it was, how the shrubbery was arranged around it,how no unnecessary accessories poked out sorely. Grey lifted her skirt.She carried herself up the steps like that of an altar, as if she was asacrificial lamb — about to offer herself to Joanne, to decades ofwaiting before a lonely grave. She turned the door knob. It was shut.She tries again. Never did words hurt her so more than the sign thatpressed itself up against the window: CLOSED.  <i>How dare they keep herfrom her?</i> A drop of rain theatrically lands on her cap, as if theperiod to the death sentence Grey felt hanging above the nape of herneck. <i>What if she had married, what if the love she had chosen wasnot worthy of the fortune of time she spent on it.</i> She grasped ontoa nearby railing, the red rust crunching into her fine gloves, and herfine gloves becoming inkish under the accelerating rain — it was allbecoming a single blur. This is real, <i>she was not dreaming</i>, onlythat it felt immoral that her gift was somewhere in “there”, on somehardy table, and here she was, on the steps, a fake devotee, a phoney,nothing at all.</p><p>She stood at the door above the street, back erect and chin stillsharp, but she seemed so small. One could see from the house across thestreet, a lady, two and forty, hidden beneath the armour of a blackgown, arms mechanically crossed like a nutcracker. And what was in hereyes? The defensiveness of an animal backed into a corner, the hardnessof someone who has lived in a room of her own, the wicked brilliance ofa narrow creek that managed to carve a path for herself. Grey peered inone last time, into the dark of the closed post office. She could makeout a golden outline now that the sun was halfway down the horizon,taking its last breath, exhaling soft rays into the office, diffused,spreading about. The brain did not matter at all! Grey can feel it, shewas the thread being woven, and time, forever headed in one directionwhile immovable in the other, was finally within her grasp. She was nolonger parsing, with glimpses of truth bestowing upon her. But she toowas that divine hand. She could see it now. In the back, on a shelf — itsat like an Emperor: a glorious, brown package. <i>That</i> wasJoanne’s, <i>that</i> was hers. <i>Theirs</i>. She was sure of it. Andshe will be back tomorrow.</p></div></div></body><script>const short_base = 'greys-gift'</script><script src="./d3.v7.min.js"></script><script src="./d3-dispatch@3.js"></script><script src="./d3-quadtree@3.js"></script><script src="./d3-timer@3.js"></script><script src="./d3-force@3.js"></script><script src=script.js></script>
