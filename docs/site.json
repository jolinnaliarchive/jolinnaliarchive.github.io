At the secluded Biological Research Station at Pembroke,\nVirginia, an analogous relationship between creative and scientific\nprocesses surfaced. It was one of trial and error, and at times, much\nfrustration. When things come to a halt, one turns to community,\nconversing and exchanging ideas until it feels right to venture out\nagain. And the effect is often a rippling one. The flow of inspiration\nfrom person to person, like the complex ecological networks that\nsurround us, underscore the symbiotic relationship between the creator\nof the film and the many creators within the film. Between the artists,\nfantastical visions are transposed and realized, while ideas of\ntransparency, authorial voice, and “candidness” are stretched,\namplified, and questioned. This film was first screened at Mountain Lake\nat our student Artlab Showcase and was officially selected for the Down\nEast Flick Fest in Greenville, North Carolina where it will be screened\nin late November.</p>\n</div><iframe class=film-yt src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/pgWBt0oGZjU\" title=\"YouTube player for a rolling stone gathers no moss\" frameborder=0 allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe><div class=stills><img class=still src='media/a-rolling-stone-gathers-no-moss/1.webp'><img class=still src='media/a-rolling-stone-gathers-no-moss/2.webp'><img class=still src='media/a-rolling-stone-gathers-no-moss/3.webp'><img class=still src='media/a-rolling-stone-gathers-no-moss/4.webp'><img class=still src='media/a-rolling-stone-gathers-no-moss/5.webp'><img class=still src='media/a-rolling-stone-gathers-no-moss/6.webp'><img class=still src='media/a-rolling-stone-gathers-no-moss/7.webp'><img class=still src='media/a-rolling-stone-gathers-no-moss/8.webp'><img class=still src='media/a-rolling-stone-gathers-no-moss/9.webp'><img class=still src='media/a-rolling-stone-gathers-no-moss/10.webp'><img class=still src='media/a-rolling-stone-gathers-no-moss/11.webp'></div>","group":"experimental"},"wreck":{"title":"wreck","page":"<div class=film-intro><h2 class=film-title>wreck</h2><div class=film-medium>Digital, Blackmagic HD</div><p>Through visual and aural language, this film opens discussion between\nthe impermanence of the individual alongside the irreparable effects\nhumankind has had on the environment.

Frequenting childhood tales, wolves are a\nsymbol of cunning and corruption. But what happens when the very things\nwe warn children about are eliminated due to our collective,\nirreversible damage? Created by previous art resident Ed Miller at\nMountain Lake, The Red Wolf wearily watches over the coming and going of\nfield scientists, researchers, and their families to the research\nstation. Spotting the statue in the dark, a displaced urbanite might\nscurry, not knowing that the only wolves that remain in the mountains\nare made from clay. On the surface, Mountain Lake is a secluded\nsanctuary – no cellular connection, lots of overgrown trails, and a\nself-sufficient plumbing system. Seeing a fallen Hemlock teeming with\ndecomposers, beetles and fungus, one might muse at primordial beauty and\nremark on the cycle of life and the transient presence of humankind. But\neven so, the world around it is changing. Due to its elevation, the\nstation had been free from poison ivy and ticks – until recently. The\nincrease in temperatures have catalyzed these creatures’ slow creep to\nthe station, including one that eats away at the hemlock population.\nPerhaps it’s time to start from scratch, turn to the very ecological\nnetworks that we harm, fighting for harmony.

She crouches, her shoulder\nblades drawn back as she leans over the edge of the high-rise that used\nto be our vegetable garden. Her body is arced with tension; she is about\nto spring forth, open her arms in rapture and glide through a sliver of\nthe horizon – swirling, deep, and orange. I believe that she can fly and\nI grin because I have always known that she was destined for great\nthings. That is the faith daughters have in mothers. I feel suspended\nwith her as she leaps, with pleasure and without thinking. But she\nplummets instead. In my sleep I am still not sure if we are two\ndifferent people or the same person. I am falling with her just as I am\nwatching. When I wake, shaking her residue off like cold dew, I become\nlucid and fraught with grim implications – that the hole I left in her\nwas so complete and unshakable I had begun to imagine us doing horrible\nthings to ourselves.</p>\n<p>This year was the same. I had left a crack open in my window the\nnight before and the cold rush of morning traffic woke me. The\ndownwardness of my mother’s leap lingered at my temples. I rubbed at my\neyelids and I finally remembered to exhale, a hot breath escaping me as\nif I had been holding it in all night. I turned onto my belly and\nreached into my pillowcase to remove a red envelope, the paper so soft\nfrom age it had the texture of a handkerchief. From it I pulled out a\ntuft of hair. She had cut it from my head when I was born. I imagined\nher patting my baby scalp and deciding selfishly to save some of it for\nherself. I must have inherited that selfishness because when I left\nTaipei I fumbled through her drawers and took it with me. I had paused\nover her jade bangle and emergency cash, slightly nauseous from the\nsmell of mothballs, but I left those there. It felt good to just take a\npiece of me she had kept. Looking at my own limp hair, I ran the strands\nthrough my fingers. They were soft like dawn. I brought them to my nose\nand inhaled but I couldn't smell anything.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>It all started with a television set. I told my mother that my best\nfriend Gao Wen had a new flatscreen at her house. My mother was frying\nan egg and she paused in her swift movements. Her hair, long and black\nto her hips, swung subtly back and forth.</p>\n<p>“Why do you need a TV?” she asked.</p>\n<p>“I never said that, I just thought it was cool,” I replied. “We\nwatched a nature documentary on it and the lizard looked like it was\nabout to jump out of the screen!”</p>\n<p>She laughed lightly and flipped the egg in the pan. She had painted\nher nails pink the day before at work and they matched her slippers.\nWhen I had asked her if her boss cared that she was doing her nails at\nthe front desk, she just shrugged. Her pale hands moved in and out of\nthe morning light, catching glints that sharpened the pink to a red. She\nused to paint them that color. Until I told her my favorite color was\npink when I was ten. Soon after everything we owned became that color —\npink radio on the window still, matching pink bathrobes, pink soap. When\nI started liking purple more I was afraid to tell her.</p>\n<p>The door to the kitchen creaked open. It was my grand-uncle; we were\nliving in his house at the time. He moved slowly, almost imperceptibly,\nbut his eyes were still quick with life and I could see him calculating,\nadding up the money he got every month from his pension and tenants.</p>\n<p>“Er Shu Shu!” my mother said, rushing to help him to a seat. He was\nalmost deaf and did not hear her, his eyes whirling around in panic as\nshe approached him from the side. The egg started burning. She was too\nfrugal with the oil. I got up and turned off the stove, sliding the egg\nfrom the pan and onto a plate.</p>\n<p>“Where is Maria?” my mother fumed. Maria was the nurse from Indonesia\nmy uncle hired to take care of his dad. “They are paying her, not\nme!”</p>\n<p>“I saw on the news that there was some flash flooding last night,\nmaybe something happened?” I said.</p>\n<p>“Don’t be a crow’s mouth!” my mother gently slapped me on the wrist.\n“God, I hope she gets here soon.”</p>\n<p>I stayed quiet. Crow’s mouth was when someone mentions a possible\nunlucky event, superstition goes that it will actually come true. It was\nmy mother’s greatest pet peeve.</p>\n<p>Maria arrived in a couple of minutes as I was scooping congee into\nour bowls.</p>\n<p>“I’m so sorry, they had to close some of the lanes,” she said, her\nChinese slow and broken.</p>\n<p>“It’s Ok-la,” my mother chimed. “Safety first, take your time.”</p>\n<p>I set the bowls on the table. Maria hungrily eyed the bowls and I\nlooked down guiltily. My mother was strict about food in the house.\nShe’s being paid in money, not food and drink, she’d always say. I\nsecretly disagreed, it wasn’t <em>her</em> money.</p>\n<p>“Oh shoot, I still haven’t washed my face yet,” my mother said,\nfanning her face. That was code for: I haven’t done my makeup yet. She\nsat down and skimmed the top of her bowl of congee with her chopsticks.\nI watched as she got up, having sat down for not even a full minute,\nheaded to her room.</p>\n<p>“You can give this to Bao Luo,” she said.</p>\n<p>Bao Luo was our alleyway dog. Today was another lucky day for\nhim.</p>\n<p>I sighed as she left. The steam of her unfinished congee abstracted\nthe beaded curtain leading to the back room, where Maria fussed over my\ngrand-uncle; she was slow but gentle. I ate quickly so that the food\nwouldn’t go cold.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Gao Wen and I were not quite delinquents, but we were surely not on\nany teacher’s favorites list. Nobody expected big things from us. There\nwas a small “waterfall” behind our school which was essentially a 10\nfoot dam with a steel pipe that sputtered out water into a small pond.\nWe thought it was the most magical place in the world. We found it in\nthe beginning of middle school but went there less and less\nfrequently.</p>\n<p>We still upheld the tradition of going right before exams. We felt\nlike kids again, casting spells with twigs and prodding at the mud on\nthe banks of the pond. It was a good release from constant test prep\nclasses that ran late into the night.</p>\n<p>I remember the day before finals in our last year of high school,\nwhen we sat on the rocks under the dam, our schoolgirl skirts were\nspeckled by the water from the pipe. Light filtered in through the fresh\nleaves, still glossy and unabashed in their newness. I yearned for a\nmore expansive canopy, for the exams to be over and summer to arrive.\nGao Wen was quiet in her ways, and she relied on games and good\nquestions to mediate conversations.</p>\n<p>“Would you rather be a princess or a witch?” she asked.</p>\n<p>“Witch!” I said quickly. “I want to be able to cast spells!”</p>\n<p>Gao Wen replied that she would want to be a princess. “There are more\npeople to keep me company in a castle. Witches live alone.”</p>\n<p>I thought about this. “But you’ll be powerful enough to get whatever\nyou want, isn’t that better?”</p>\n<p>Gao Wen shrugged. “What else could I want? I’d be a princess.”</p>\n<p>I waved my arms in exasperation. An idea strikes: “You could get as\nmuch mango shaved ice as you want.”</p>\n<p>Gao Wen considers this. “Tempting… but I feel like if I were a\nprincess people would just bring it to me if I asked.”</p>\n<p>I rolled my eyes. “Ok, be your princess.”</p>\n<p>I decided to stand up and leave Gao Wen on the rocks as I looked for\ncrawling critters in the pond water. I knew it made her nervous but that\nwas kind of the point.</p>\n<p>“Have you seen the kid from America?” Gao Wen asked.</p>\n<p>“Oh the one with the hair as yellow as straw?” I said, a little\nlouder than my normal voice so that she could still hear.</p>\n<p>“Yeah, Mai-chal,” Gao Wen said.</p>\n<p>“He is really quiet, I guess his Chinese isn’t really good.”</p>\n<p>“Yeah,” said Gao Wen. “He’s teaching me some English.”</p>\n<p>I could tell she was debating whether or not to reveal more\ninformation. I stayed quiet. “He said he was returning to America after\nclasses ended. But he has two really young siblings. His parents are\nlooking for a nanny that speaks Chinese.”</p>\n<p>I felt my eyes grow wide. “Did he ask you?”</p>\n<p>“He did, but he also asked if I knew anybody who would want to do it\nif I couldn’t.”</p>\n<p>Things like this just happened to Gao Wen. I feigned nonchalance,\npretending to find something interesting in the water.</p>\n<p>“You should do it,” I suggested.</p>\n<p>“No no, my parents would never let me. I’m supposed to go to college\nhere,” she said. “Plus, a new place is so scary and I would hate it\nthere. My English isn’t <em>that</em> good.”</p>\n<p>I shrugged having done my due diligence as the encouraging,\nadventurous friend.</p>\n<p>“But maybe you should go,” said Gao Wen. “I told him about you and he\nsaid your English is better than mine.”</p>\n<p>“Why would you do that before asking me?” I asked. “Why would you\njust assume that I would want to go?”</p>\n<p>“You don’t like it here, you’re the class poet, you’re the dreamer,”\nsaid Gao Wen. She suddenly got up, animated. She mimicked the Statue of\nLiberty, torch in hand. “Come to the land of dreams!”</p>\n<p>I wagged my head, but was secretly flattered, even hopeful.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Later that month I came back from tutoring to find a brand new\ntelevision on the coffee table. It was sleek and shiny, completely out\nof place against our wicker sofa with cushions rotting from humidity.\nEven the smell of the room shifted with the arrival of this sci-fi\nlooking apparatus – a tinge more plastic. I stood there in\ndisbelief.</p>\n<p>“Ma…” I hollered. “How did you get this?”</p>\n<p>No response, so I decided she was at work and I started dinner. Our\nfridge stank from the volume of leftovers, all in black containers\nstacked and anonymous. I fumbled through them, smelling carefully before\ndeciding to give it to Bao Luo or to heat it up in a pan. It was only\nuntil the food was piled up on the table that I thought something was\namiss.</p>\n<p>Her room was in the little studio above my grand uncle’s garage. To\nget there I had to cross the alleyway between it and the main house, one\nof the last surviving one-story buildings on the busy Taipei street.</p>\n<p>May in the city was alive with the sound of motorcycles and bugs as\nthe smoke of late night grills pulsed through the air in waves. Vines\nsnaked across the house’s walls and small violet flowers, looking\nsurreal in bluish security light lighting bloomed in explosive bursts.\nThe staircase from the garage to her room was narrow and lopsided. I\nhated going up there.</p>\n<p>I opened the door and found her sleeping feverishly. Her bed was\nunder a bright pink mosquito tent and through it, moonlight casted a\nwhite glow onto her brow.</p>\n<p>“What happened?” I said to myself.</p>\n<p>Her room was a mess. Fake luxury perfumes and designer bags lined\nevery wall, a thin path spiraled from the door to her bed and desk\namidst the clutter of wigs and make up and magazines. I went to her desk\nand found a stack of papers. Apart from the rest of her room, those\npapers seemed sterile and alert. There were numbers and graphs and\nsignatures, but the words that stood out were <em>blood plasma\ndonation</em>. I immediately grew red and embarrassed. In the sweet\nstink of her room, I wanted to unzip the mosquito tent over her bed and\nthrow the papers in her face.</p>\n<p>“I must’ve lost track of time,” I heard her grumble.</p>\n<p>“I didn’t ask for a TV,” I said.</p>\n<p>“I know, but isn’t it so nice!” a lazy smile appeared on her face as\nif she was still dreaming. “You were right, the people look so real on\nthe big screen.”</p>\n<p>“You lied on this. You can’t be doing this twice a week. You’ll die,”\nI said.</p>\n<p>“Crow’s mouth!” We stared at each other as she slowly realized that I\nwas still angry, and that made her even angrier. “I should change your\nname and call you little crow. Do you want me to die?”</p>\n<p>The accusation burned me. Instead of answering I count the number of\nacrylic nails on the ground. There were seven.</p>\n<p>“What does Er Shu Shu think?” I asked.</p>\n<p>“Don’t try to use him against me.” She narrowed her eyes. “You are\nnever grateful.”</p>\n<p>She said the word never with so much finality I felt my heart slam up\nagainst something in my chest. She decided to add, “I saw him watching\nthe news on it earlier. He <em>loves</em> it.”</p>\n<p>I nodded to myself. I felt silly, my head bobbing up and down in my\nmother’s dollhouse room, trying to love a flatscreen TV.</p>\n<p>“How was work?”</p>\n<p>Her acidity subsided and she returned to her childlike grin. She\nstretched her arms out, her dainty wrists adorned in silly bracelets.\n<em>Completely immature!</em> My eyes wandered down to the scars on the\ninsides of her elbows. I imagined her smiling politely in the hospital\nas they stabbed her, again and again. I felt sick. I felt a weight that\nwould never be lifted because of how much she loved me.</p>\n<p>“No more work for me, I quit,” she said.</p>\n<p>My shock quickly subsided. This was a common occurrence.</p>\n<p>“What? So we can watch TV?” I said.</p>\n<p>“Don’t worry about it.” She got up from bed and paced towards me,\nstepping on an eyelash curler and wincing. I winced with her. She put\nher hands around my arms and examined me. I was so much more tanner than\nher, and I smelled of kitchen fire. A smile rippled across her face.\n“I’d get anything for you.”</p>\n<p>That night we fell asleep on the wicker sofa. I woke in the middle of\nthe night and watched the unnatural colors from the TV screen light up\nmy mother's beautiful face. I turned my attention to the screen, rubbing\nmy eyes and feeling my eyelids crunch. I tried to blink my eyes back\ninto clarity, but I failed. All sound grew faint, even the passing of\ntraffic became just a murmur. I felt the back of my shoulders glued to\nmy seat as my eyes stayed open. The screen before me expanded, images\nturned to pure color as my mother and I and the wicker sofa were\nabsorbed by a sea of neon green. From the noise I saw myself, or a\nsilhouette of me, emerge from a puddle of red, as red as my mother’s\npink nails in harsh morning light. My clone walked towards my mother and\nput her face beside hers. I watched on as this static version of me\nmelted into her. I could no longer differentiate the two. My mother’s\nskin became static, the curves of her chin and neck obscured by noise. I\nblinked again and I was inside this half mother, half television\nmonster, the world a grainy, rainbow mess. All I knew was that we were\none and the same. The two of us, all three of us. We were the same. I\nwas paralyzed and I could feel my stomach twisting into knots, and then\nthose knots folding onto themselves. I was positive that I was going to\nvomit. That was when I decided to leave home with Michael’s family to\nAmerica.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>A decade later, I stare at a bright LED screen in a shop window. I am\nat the Prudential Center because it is still frigid in Boston and there\nis not much to do except to wander around indoor malls, deciding what I\ncannot afford. On the TVs they are playing stock footage of ginkgo\ntrees. The camera moves up and down tiny golden fans.</p>\n<p>They never told me how she died, just that she was found cold in her\nbed two months after I left. It could have been the blood donations. But\nit also could have been me. That winter I saw my first snowfall in\nAmerica and the world grew quiet, insulated by a soft, white cocoon. I\nwore my clothes from Taiwan in awkward layers as I felt the retraction\nof all life around me. I became mute for a long time. The snow on the\noutside crept inside me and any sound I tried to make was absorbed by\nit. The children I was supposed to take care of tugged at me, asking for\ntheir juice boxes, for me to read them stories about fairies and\ndragons, for the right pronunciation for home in Chinese. Their\nneediness rescued me and I began saving my money like it was water and I\nwas crossing a desert. I put myself through school. I did hard things.\nAll the while I would browse plane tickets to Taiwan ever so often,\npunishing myself. I haven’t been back. Instead, I watch her fall in my\ndreams, and I wake up smelling my baby hair wishing it was hers.</p>\n<p>I look back at the screens of endless fields of ginkgo, their\nbranches wildly intersecting and then shooting off and then intersecting\nagain. I could smell perfume from department stores, so alike to hers in\ntheir dizzying effect. The TVs buzz with energy, an energy I had been\nparalyzed by before. I remember hearing that gingko leaves fall all at\nonce. It was as if the trees heard me thinking through the screen. They\nfall instantly, and the dead leaves now morph into someone I could\ntouch. Maybe it was her from my dreams. She approached me and sighed.\nHer exhalation washed over me, so bright that I blinked through my\ntears, concentrating on my own small palms so as not to be blinded. We\nwere finally two different people. I felt myself wrapped in pixelated\ngold. I have not been warm like this in a long time. She reached out and\ntouched my face, reminded me of the power of leaving, forgave me for it,\nand then beckoned me home. I called Gao Wen that night.</p>\n</div>","group":"writing"},"conversations-with-a-phantom-piano":{"title":"Conversations with a Phantom Piano","page":"<div class=story>\n\t\t<h2>Conversations with a Phantom Piano</h2>\n\t\t<span class=story-date>Spring 2023</span>\n\t\t<hr><p>Anya sits on the piano bench. There was no piano, but she runs her\nfingers along imaginary keys anyways. There are broken skylight windows\nabove her, and from them, light shoots down white and harsh, making a\nsplintery mess. Her fingers dance and she sways a little with them, her\nknuckles coming in and out of the skylight’s illumination. She isn’t\npressing the keys — she is swimming through them, as if ripping the\ninstrument apart to make a new kind of music.</p>\n<p>It is a warm day. Small birds peck at the grass growing where the\nwalls meet the earth. The space had lost its interior timbre, all of the\nghosts having escaped through the cracks of the concrete walls. It used\nto be a high school cafeteria, back before schools integrated. This was\nthe colored school that got shut down. Now, forest sounds permeate the\nair. Things have settled for the last time. Anya settles too, her piece\nover. She can hear the Huntingdon kids creeping in, wearing their dress\npants and plaid skirts, white button downs ironed by their grandmas and\nnannies. She moves to a corner obscured by tall rusty carts that would\nmake a lot of sound if knocked over.</p>\n<p>“This is our kingdom,” the girl with the short hair says. Anya knows\nthat her name is Heather Smith. She can see her shuffling around the\nrubble along with the other two kids, a bunch of dandelions limp in her\ncoat pocket.</p>\n<p>“Are you the king? Are we your subjects?” asks the tall boy — Rory.\nHe was probably the one who picked the dandelions.</p>\n<p>Heather reaches out her hand. Her slender arm makes the perfect line\nfrom her shoulder to her fingertips. Rory bends down, smelling her skin;\nhe kisses her hand. Anya cannot imagine being touched in such an open\nway.</p>\n<p>Dash, the short boy, his name short for Richard Dashner, shakes his\nhead to himself. “Rory be careful, I swear if she tells you to jump off\na bridge all you’ll do is ask how high.”</p>\n<p>Heather snorts. Rory is unfazed. “That’s so silly Dash, I wouldn’t\nask questions. I’d just jump.”</p>\n<p>Dash shakes his head in disbelief. They sit on the ground, Heather\nand Rory back to back, reading two copies of the same book. Anya likes\nthe sliver of space between their lower part of their backs, light\nstreaming through them and around them. She thinks they look like a pair\nof wings. Dash lays out flat beside Rory with his own book lying face\ndown between pages on his chest. He lights a cigarette and starts\nsucking it. Anya watches the puffs of grey escape his mouth, irregular\nshapes that expand until they disappear. She knows, that even watching\nhim from a distance, she could watch his mouth moving forever, lopsided,\nlike he was hiding something in its asymmetry.</p>\n<p>“What are you reading?” asked Heather suddenly. Rory looks\ninquisitively at his book which was the same as hers, but then realizes\nthe question was directed at Dash. Dash takes a second to realize this\ntoo. He turns his head up to the side.</p>\n<p>“Crime and Punishment,” he says.</p>\n<p>“Thinking about murdering anybody recently and then embarking a quest\nof moral quandary?” says Heather</p>\n<p>“Ha! Why would I kill anyone? There’s no need,” replies Dash.</p>\n<p>“Well that’s only if you get caught. Doesn’t the guy in the book\nnever get caught?” asks Rory.</p>\n<p>“To be simply put, I don’t think I’d pull it off,” says Dash. “Also,\nhe totally gets caught. I’m at that part now.”</p>\n<p>“I think someone pulled it off quite recently,” says Rory.</p>\n<p>His words hit Dash’s brows. Anya sees every tendon in his body\ntighten.</p>\n<p>“That girl with the glasses. Some unique trailer trash,” continues\nRory. “Can’t even drive.”</p>\n<p>“I don’t know what Dr. Palmer saw in her, letting her come to\nHuntingdon. I’ll admit, she can play the piano … but nobody knew what\nwas going on in that big head of hers,” says Heather.</p>\n<p>Dash stays quiet but exaggeratedly opens his book, obscuring his face\nfrom Anya — the world. He begins reading and and the three are submerged\nup to their shoulders in silence.</p>\n<p>The ground Anya sits on is damp. She can feel the water going through\nher jeans, her underwear. But she likes the coolness in the dark corner,\nseeming to have been there for ages. It felt safe. Anya scoots against\nthe wall, feels the dampness spread across her shoulder blades. She\ncloses her eyes.</p>\n<p><i>What piece were you playing?</i></p>\n<p>Nothing in particular.</p>\n<p><i>What was the song?</i></p>\n<p>There wasn’t a song. It was just me pretending to play the piano.</p>\n<p><i>But I could really feel it, you know?  Like there were vibrations\nyou were putting out.</i></p>\n<p>Thanks.</p>\n<p><i>You should teach someone.</i></p>\n<p>I did. Why are you asking me this?</p>\n<p><i>Because I think it would help me understand what you were playing,\nthe reason why I exist.</i></p>\n<p>You don’t exist. I was just waving my hands around.</p>\n<p><i>You said you were pretending to play the piano. I am the piano.\nAlbeit a pretend piano. Did they quit?</i></p>\n<p>What?</p>\n<p><i>The person you taught.</i></p>\n<p>Not by choice.</p>\n<p><i>Does it have something to do with the kids over there?</i></p>\n<p>Yes… obliquely. Not really. Only Dash.</p>\n<p><i>You were what they were talking about.</i></p>\n<p>Maybe…</p>\n<p><i>What happened?</i></p>\n<p>Sometimes you don’t even know you’ve memorized a piece and then you\ngo somewhere without the sheet music and you stumble upon a piano and\nyou just start playing and it’s, it’s, it’s…</p>\n<p><i>Muscle memory?</i></p>\n<p>Yeah, but it scares me.</p>\n<p><i>What?</i></p>\n<p>How the body remembers. I haven’t touched an actual piano since.</p>\n<p><i>Ha! An actual piano! That hurts!</i></p>\n<p>You’re not even real.</p>\n<p><i>Hmph…</i></p>\n<p><i>…What does your body remember?</i></p>\n<p>My eyes, they remember how they were pierced as I exited the dimly\nlit store and out into the parking lot. I could feel the heat from the\npavement through my sandals as I padded to my car.  My lips still wet\nfrom kissing. I remember the metal of my car door stinging my skin.  My\nnose remembers the smell of piss. I can feel him between my arms, his\nskin lifeless in dead air.</p>\n<p><i>And he was the one you taught to play?</i></p>\n<p>Yes.</p>\n<p><i>Was he good?</i></p>\n<p>He was ok, he always asked me for skittles after our lesson. He had a\nraspy little voice. He liked scales, hated chords. His hands were too\nsmall.</p>\n<p><i>So he died.</i></p>\n<p>Yes, but that was not the worst part.</p>\n<p><i>How could it get any worse that that?</i></p>\n<p>Things always get worse. Especially when you think you hit rock\nbottom.</p>\n<p><i>But how do you get to ‘rock bottom’? Do you fall, do you lower\nyourself gently?</i></p>\n<p>Maybe. It’s interesting that you say “lower yourself”. I thought it\nwasn’t something you can get to yourself, but a combination of external\nfactors. But I think it is very possible to self-inflict. So you know\nthe concept of up and down?</p>\n<p><i>Yes. Up is silence, down is the opposite of that. Down is melodic.\nDown is pressure — presence, solid.</i></p>\n<p>Then imagine rock bottom as infinite sound, like that siren that rang\nafter the worst finally happened, the siren that would stay in my ears\nthe days after. It’s so solid it’s like a giant finger pressing on your\nchest.</p>\n<p><i>Anya. We must start at the beginning, the bottom is where the\nanswers are. But I do not know the questions.</i></p>\n<p>Yes, we must start at the beginning.</p>\n<p><i>The answers are infinite, but they converge at the question, at\nthe beginning. Yes, let’s go there, to the beginning.</i></p>\n<p>I no longer think about the beginning, because it makes me feel the\npassing seconds so much more. I am hurting every second. I am being dug\ninto. I will not be forgiven.</p>\n<p><i>what is it to be forgiven?</i></p>\n<p>It’s when you tell someone that wronged you that you have processed\nit and that you accept them as a person.</p>\n<p><i>So they can’t accept you. You feel like you’ve been\nexiled.</i></p>\n<p>I think they don’t want to process it either. It’s beyond the realm\nof things they want to deal with. They have other things to worry\nabout.</p>\n<p><i>Like what?</i></p>\n<p>Cruises. Business deals. Their pet tigers. The kids are now thinking\nabout prom. What dress to wear. The girls with curly hair want their\nhair straightened, the girls with straight hair want their hair\ncurled.</p>\n<p><i>I still don’t understand.</i></p>\n<p>What?</p>\n<p><i>Why do you need to be forgiven?</i></p>\n<p>Because I can’t go on feeling like I owe those people, who I already\nowed so much to, I am knee deep in indebtedness. I can’t believe the\nmoral superiority that boiled underneath my skin, when I have done an\nirrevocable act. And they don’t even know the truth.</p>\n<p><i>This must have something to do with the song you’ve been\nplaying.</i></p>\n<p>Maybe.</p>\n<p><i>I need to know the song.</i></p>\n<p>Ok. The beginning?</p>\n<p><i>Yes, Anya. Let’s start there.</i></p>\n<p>I guess it would have to start with Dr. Palmer. He approached me\nafter my first recital when we got to Georgia, he said I should apply to\nHuntingdon. That I was too good for public school. His hair was oiled\nand he smelled like pine trees. He told me and my mom that he thought I\nwas an angel and that he actually liked my hair.</p>\n<p>“It’s so black and shiny?!” he had noted.</p>\n<p>My mom was so relieved someone wanted to talk to us, she may have\nnodded too vigorously. I noticed that he was annoyed with her, her\neagerness. I secretly laughed at her in my head too because I hated how\nshe wanted to be a part of something so badly. Like our family wasn’t\nenough for her, she had to be in a continuous state of expansion. She\nconsumed so much, she kept up with everything —  the latest fashion,\nbeauty products, omega-3 supplements, after school programs for gifted\nkids. My mom is the kind of mom that spent a whole day cleaning when she\nheard guests were coming over. I thought it was stupid. No matter how\nmuch you clean a trailer you’re still in a trailer. She would sit on the\nsofa across from the keyboard when I played and take notes. And then she\nwould make me play in front of her friends. She felt entitled to it, my\ntalent. A flick of her wrist pulled me out of whatever I was doing and\nonto the piano bench.</p>\n<p><i>But you like playing piano, no?</i></p>\n<p>Yes.</p>\n<p><i>So it’s thanks to her.</i></p>\n<p>Well, not for a while. For a while I hated it. But I guess if we’re\ntalking about beginnings she is the start of everything. My life. My\npain. My love.</p>\n<p><i>So that is what I am made of, your pain and love. Tell me about\nDash.</i></p>\n<p>Nobody talked to me at Huntingdon about anything other than me\nperforming at their aunt’s wedding or how good I was at playing piano.\nBut the first time I met Dash he told me my glasses were crooked.</p>\n<p><i>Were they?</i></p>\n<p>Yes. He’s very honest.</p>\n<p><i>Do you find honesty important?</i></p>\n<p>I don’t know. I don’t think my mom strived for me to have an honest\npersonality. I’ve been building something inside me.</p>\n<p><i>What have you been building?</i></p>\n<p>This wall, I can’t be myself no matter how hard I try. I am either on\nthe wall looking down at people, or I’m down below with this\ninsurmountable thing before me. No matter how hard I try I am falling\nfrom the top but simultaneously stuck at the bottom. Condescending yet\nimmobile.</p>\n<p><i>What does Dash have to do with this?</i></p>\n<p>I was answering your question about honesty.</p>\n<p><i>But this isn’t about that either, is it?</i></p>\n<p>Yeah isn’t that what life is? Extrapolating meaning from\nmeaninglessness. If you do it too much it hurts.</p>\n<p><i>Extrapolate it.</i></p>\n<p>What?</p>\n<p><i>What does Dash have to do with the wall?</i></p>\n<p>He was like a gate. I could go through the wall if I was with him. He\nlent me books. He would kiss me on the cheek. In a soft kind of way.</p>\n<p><i>But?</i></p>\n<p>But…but he only kissed me in the one corner of the library that no\none could see. He didn’t let me talk to Rory or Heather. I was like\nhis…</p>\n<p><i>His pet?</i></p>\n<p>Well, that’s an exaggeration. The problem was probably just that I\nthought about him too much.</p>\n<p><i>Anya, you’re not making sense. How do we get to the car and the\npiss?</i></p>\n<p>Dash let me borrow his camera, for an art project. I decided that I\nwould go around the rich suburban homes and take pictures of them. I was\na fan of bird baths and garden gnomes.</p>\n<p>I had been staying up pretty late. I was memorizing so many pieces at\nthat time. I was a walking gramophone. I knew all the cheesy wedding\npieces, like Canon in D. I could play that one in my sleep. There was\nalso the kid I was teaching piano to at that time. Louis. He had fat\ncheeks, cherub-like. His pale face was always slightly flushed, either\nfrom running outside or from napping way too long. His mom treated him\nlike a teddy bear, her tight embrace following him wherever he went. She\nwas the President of the Garden Bookclub, and my mom delegated me with\nthe task of teaching Louis piano with the hope that she would eventually\nbe invited to join the ensemble of rich housewives.</p>\n<p><i>Was she?</i></p>\n<p>No. I don’t think they even talk to her anymore, not after what\nhappened.</p>\n<p>It was the Sunday before the week the project was due, and I headed\nout early to take the pictures.</p>\n<p>The trailer was quiet. It was a long box with linoleum surfaces and\nuneven floors. But the floors were always clean. I like walking barefoot\non them, feeling the protrusions and divots beneath me. Dawn crept in\nthrough the plastic blinders and spilled onto the surfaces, drawing\nyellow hemispheres over the countertops. I grabbed the camera and took\nthe car. I thought I would be back by noon so my mother wouldn’t\nnotice.</p>\n<p>The first house I went to was modern and painted black. It had blue\nshutters and abstract statues that looked like ginormous columns of\nseaweed. I could see a young family through the crystal clear window,\ntoys spilled over a carpeted floor, a woman dressed her Sunday best. I\nsnapped a picture and moved on.</p>\n<p>I kept walking down the street, some houses were more traditional\nlooking, stone walls and castle-like. I come across this green house\nshrouded by trees. I notice the outline of what seemed to be a giant\nbird between the crossing branches. I wanted to get a closer look so I\nwalked along the white fence on the edge of the yard. I knew I was\ntrespassing, but I thought that whoever lived there might be already at\nchurch, so there was no harm. I would just get the picture and go.</p>\n<p>But then I saw. It was the Huntingdon kids. Rory and Heather and some\nother people I didn’t know but would snicker at me in the hallways. They\nwere surrounded by beasts. That huge bird, rainbow and magnificent.\nTigers, zebras, peacocks. The animals seemed subdued, completely tame,\nwhile the kids pulled at their fur and ears, little gods in a garden of\neden. Some music was playing in the background, faint but pulsing; and\nthe flora matched the fauna with its vigor and exoticism. Fans of green,\nblossoms of pink, primordial vines, all draped on the big chestnut trees\nover a perfectly kept lawn. It didn’t smell like animals, instead, an\nintoxicating fragrance permeated the air.</p>\n<p>I looked at their tea cups. And I swear—</p>\n<p><i>What?</i></p>\n<p>There were bones in them. Small bones.</p>\n<p>I stood there, feeling like the dumbest person in the world, and then\nI snapped a picture. Right then, Anya must have noticed me because I\nremember her raising her perfect hand, admonishing me. I felt a\ncrackling in my temples and I turned and ran. I ran faster than I have\never run in my life. I knew something bad was about to happen.</p>\n<p>I got into my car and hit the gas. I drove straight to Louis’ house.\nI knew that sometimes his mom would let him sleep in while she went to\nchurch. I knocked on the door, he opened it after peeping through the\nwindow.</p>\n<p>“Hi Anya!” he squealed, clearly awake.</p>\n<p>“I’m gonna take you somewhere fun!” I said, scooping him up in my\narms.</p>\n<p>We got to the store, the one that offered to print pictures. I wanted\nto print the picture immediately. I did not know what I would do with\nit, but I knew it would give me something those kids already had. But\nwhen I entered the store, Dash was already there.</p>\n<p>“Anya, give me the camera.”</p>\n<p>“No, the project’s due in two days, let me print the pictures.”</p>\n<p>Dash gave me a long look. “They told me you trespassed.”</p>\n<p>“Just let me print the pictures.”</p>\n<p>“I can’t let you do that Anya.”</p>\n<p>“I love you.”</p>\n<p>He grabbed my arm and took the camera from me. I thought about Louis\nin my car, the skittles I gave him probably smeared and melting over his\ncute little face. I kissed Dash right then. I moved my hand under his\nshirt, felt his chest. I thought about my mother, what she wanted, and\nthen I knew I had to destroy it. We stayed there for a small eternity,\nmaking sketches of each other with our hands, tracing the edges of our\nbacks.</p>\n<p>Finally, I looked up at him.</p>\n<p>“I like how your eyes look,” he said, no. He whispered it.\n“Bewitching.”</p>\n<p>That’s when I shoved him. I shoved him so hard I heard him cry out in\npain. I grabbed the camera.</p>\n<p><i>And then that’s when you stepped outside and the hotness hit, and\nLouis was gone?</i></p>\n<p>Yes. I just got in the car anyways. I just drove. I refused to look\nat the backseat, where Louis was slumped over. I didn’t know where to\ngo. I just kept driving. I couldn’t stop. I broke out of my trance when\nI saw Dash driving behind me. Then I started noticing two other cars I\nhad seen in the school parking lot before.</p>\n<p><i>And then?</i></p>\n<p>And then…</p>\n<p><i>There was the crash, wasn’t there? And then… Louis</i></p>\n<p>gone.</p>\n<p><i>The car</i></p>\n<p>gone.</p>\n<p><i>The camera</i></p>\n<p>gone.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><i>So I went to the beginning, and I’ve reached the crash</i></p>\n<p>Is that it? Is that the end of the story?</p>\n<p><i>Maybe, maybe not. I guess that is why I am here. I have to decide,\nis this the end for me?</i></p>\n<p>What was the song I was playing?</p>\n<p><i>A song for your mother, for Dash. The things you can’t say. A song\nthat isn’t finished.</i></p>\n<p>I thought you were here to find out why you exist.</p>\n<p><i>Anya — I’m the part of you that makes up a sad talking piano\nbecause you are all alone. The part of you that keeps on making melodies\neven though you haven’t seen sheet music in a month. The part of you\nthat wonders why you had to pick up Louis. The part of you that\nunderstands why you did anyways. He was your backup plan. But you go on,\nyou pick up your things and you run. From the perfect lawns and neat\nhedges, with a camera in your hand. With pictures of things you can’t\nexplain but know too well. What will I do now?</i></p>\n<p>Anya stands. Her shirt is drenched. She knocks down the cart of\ntrays, they make a sound that thunders against the walls and rattles the\nearth.</p>\n<p>“What the fuck?” Rory says peering up from his book. Dash looks\nstraight at Anya, eyes wide.</p>\n<p>“Wait is that?” Heather turns too. Her pale eyes adjust to the dark\ncorner. “It’s that cunt.”</p>\n<p>Anya walks over, she raises two fingers to her eyes, she turns them\nand draws a line from herself to them. An invisible line, as fantastical\nand solid as her phantom piano.</p>\n</div>","group":"writing"},"surfacing":{"title":"Surfacing","page":"<div class=story>\n\t\t<h2>Surfacing</h2>\n\t\t<span class=story-date>November 10, 2022</span>\n\t\t<hr><p>“I peed into a cup today.”</p>\n<p>The words fell out of Marnie’s mouth. Nobody was there to pick them\noff the ground, thoughts not yet fully formed meant to be digested and\nnot regurgitated into the open air. She could taste them, the\ncompulsivity and randomness of her inner monologues, their acidity.\nSuddenly she felt sick. How funny. She was just at the clinic earlier\nthat day.</p>\n<p>She traversed a sidewalk soaked in wet leaves, the texture so\nmeat-like she thought she was making her way down an unfurled umbilical\ncord, air as thick as placenta. She stepped onto an empty transit bus,\nher head full of the bus’s big tires on the road, black against black.\nShe lurched either way as the bus rolled forward and felt two opposing\nforces yanking her apart. The first was the long shrieks of the bus’s\nbreaks as it barely managed to stop at each intersection, and the second\nwas the long blades of orange light that slid through the windows, a\nmixture made from the brown of wet leaves and red from the setting sun.\nThe scratches of sound and color filled the crevices of her brain like\ncold water finding its way through fractal cracks in ice. She was going\nto shatter. Thank God her stop was near.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Marnie got to Webber’s grill ten minutes late. She had left her room\na mess, clothes spilling out of drawers like limp bodies, her red scarf\nhad been spread out on her bed like a river of blood. <i>All this\ncarnage</i>, thought Marnie faced with the plain wooden doors of the\nrestaurant, <i>just to listen to a man talk about himself for two\nhours</i>. At least he’ll get the bill.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>George was tall. That was Marnie’s first impression. He had on a\ncheckered green sweater which went well with his grey, unremarkable\nface. The way he spoke was self-congratulatory, with no real intention\nof listening to the person he was talking to. He reminded Marnie of the\nfoxes used in Aesop’s fables used to tell lessons about people who\nthought they were all that.</p>\n<p>“When can I see you again?” he asked by the end of their meal. Steaks\nhad been devoured, wine consumed, the check gotten and paid for.</p>\n<p>Marnie laughed, reflexively covering her mouth. “I’ll have to check\nmy calendar, thanks for dinner.”</p>\n<p>Marnie walked George to his car, where he offered her a ride, but she\ndeclined. He drove off while she looked on, his red convertible getting\nsmaller and smaller on the dimming horizon until it was just a\ntwo-dimensional speck in the distance. She turned away from the road and\nwalked towards the downtown, crossing a bridge. Grey clouds crossed over\na deep purple sky and Marnie thought it looked like a giant blueberry\nstrudel. She reached her hands out from her pockets, stretching her\ntendons in the cold. Her hands were painted the same color as the sky,\n blisters and bruises from a week of dish duty.</p>\n<p>Her phone rang. She checked; it was her mother. She let it run its\ncourse, but when it finally stopped it was only replaced by a call from\nher sister. Marnie let out a small groan, relented, and picked up.</p>\n<p>“Marnie, she’s going crazy. Can you call her?” Emma fumed into the\nphone.</p>\n<p>“I can’t, I don’t know how to talk to her.” Marnie scratched the\nbottom edge of the bridge railing with the tip of her boot. She hoped\nthat she sounded logical, maybe even hurtful.</p>\n<p>“You’re going to have to face her eventually, it’s not safe for you,\nleaving home like that. Do you have money? I can pay for the bus.” Emma\noffered.</p>\n<p>Marnie shrugged at no one in particular.  She kept toying with the\nbridge railing, its sharp rust digging into the faux leather of her\nshoes. Then two words fluttered out of her so fast she heard herself say\nthem without saying them herself.</p>\n<p>“I’m pregnant.”</p>\n<p>For the first time, Emma paused. Phone static immediately swallowed\nup the hundred or so miles between the two sisters. A bird flew across\nthe canal and Marnie followed its path with her eyes. She knew that the\nsun had sunken completely by then because the bird’s feathers had lost\nall their color. Marnie found it poetic — a silhouette making its way\nhome in the dark.</p>\n<p>“Marnie, I don’t know what to say,” said Emma. Marnie silently\nlaughed at this confession. “Are you taking care of yourself? Have you\neaten today?”</p>\n<p>“Don’t worry about me, I had steak tonight,” Marnie smiled into the\nphone. Her head was still pounding from the wine.</p>\n<p>“Is it Nick’s?”</p>\n<p>“Well, it’s mine,” replied Marnie.</p>\n<p>Emma let out a tired sigh. She was in her softened state now, and\nMarnie liked this version of her sister, when she redirected her energy\nfrom sounding smart to defending against a common threat. Emma had won\nevery fight she has gotten in; she always got her way.</p>\n<p>“Marnie, listen to me. Are you listening? I don’t think you are. But\nthat doesn’t matter. It doesn’t matter if it’s Nick’s or whoever’s, I’ll\nconvince Mom, she’ll come around.”</p>\n<p>There was another pause. The static came in again with its distant\nprickling. No birds flew across the canal this time.</p>\n<p>“Please, come home.”</p>\n<p><i>Oh Emma,</i> thought Marnie. <i>I’m never going back, but I can’t\nbear to say it to your stupid, perfect face. </i>She hung up.</p>\n<p>Marnie sank into herself. To Emma it was all a vague memory. To\nMarnie it was a nightmare she woke up from and could never forget. The\nslaps dealt, the words fired from a shotgun tongue, the lines drawn with\npointed fingers as her own mother compared her two daughters, one her\nangel, the other one the devil herself.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>She was just a girl walking in the opposite direction that the earth\nwas spinning, wading through ghosts, her knees determined to get her\nback to that home-like place. Marnie had resisted the urge to think\nabout him for the entire day, but now the memories escaped like\nfireflies, coming in and out of illumination as her old teenage synapses\nfired, replaying the best summer that ruined her life. She let them\nfling towards her, and she caught the buzzing visions one by one,\ncrushing each between her fingers.</p>\n<p>The first time she saw Nick was behind the bleachers. The light came\nin slanted and lit up half of his face. His brown eyes were at odds with\neach other, one demure chocolate, the other brazen gold. He liked\nphilosophy and poetry, things that Marnie stood on the periphery of but\nnever dared to dive into. He took her pages of half-hazard stories and\nread them with serious brows and pursed lips. He would look up, smile,\nand reveal his tongue purpled by his favorite grape candy.</p>\n<p>She hated that the words from his mouth were the kind of thing that\ncould save her. Words so ripe like they were derived from nature itself,\ntheir odd combination of granularity and chance, something she could not\nreproduce no matter how hard she tried. She loved the look of him, that\nswirl of his brown hair, the odd tapping he did with his pinky at the\nedge of a counter or desk, his deep green hoodie, that walk full of\nschoolboy coolness.</p>\n<p>So she couldn’t even blame herself. That pivotal night when she snuck\nout of the house, evading her mother and sister’s careful gaze,\nsprinting to his car obscured by some bushes. They went to a nearby park\nand strolled under grinning, silver stars, gagging at the smell of lake\nwater and then giggling at their exaggerated disgust.</p>\n<p>A stroll led to a kiss, and that led to them in the back of his car,\nhis denim jacket hanging out the window, Marnie’s pajamas on the\ndashboard. Marnie shook her head, shaking away the summer warmth that\ncrept into her cheeks, replacing it with the stinging cold. In the end,\ncold was all she got from Nick. Here she was, walking up to a boarding\nhouse three months later, still thinking about him, left with his uneven\neyes, her own dissatisfaction.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>The door shut behind her. It was like Marnie’s past in its entirety\nwas locked away, left in the blasts of cold October air. She was now\nconfronted by her room’s stifling warmth, she refused it — this moment.\nA wave of nausea took over and Marnie bolted for the toilet bowl.</p>\n<p>When all the organic matter that was not each of her clamoring cells\nwere in the toilet, an emptiness settled into all corners of her body.\nHer clammy skin stuck to the white tiling of the bathroom, and the\nyellowing grout imprinted its gridwork onto her palms and the outside of\nher legs. Blue from the porthole window above washed over her skin, and\nwhen she leaned to examine her own throw up, it looked green and\nalive.</p>\n<p>Like words that bubbled out of her without her permission, this\nfeeling that she was all she had came pouring out, melting her vision,\nand causing her to shake. She slid from her knelt position over the\nbasin and rested her arm on the ridge of the bathtub, the energy gone\nfrom her body. Her back curved forward like a willow tree, a sour ache\nwrapped around her throat, and she felt her head droop from her neck.\nShe brought a hand up to her face and buried her eyes.</p>\n<p>There was always something she was gripping, clawing at, fighting\nwith clenched fists. Maybe that thing was the silence in response to her\nquestion “What am I without them?” whispered into a gulf as wide as the\nPacific Ocean. Maybe that thing was the fact her sister loved her so\nmuch yet so incorrectly. Maybe it was because she could not remember her\nmother saying something nice to her in the past two years. Maybe that\nthing was how she had finally been held so tight that she melted out of\nexistence completely, but now her existence felt so piercing, and that\nexistence was merging in on the existence of another thing inside her.\nShe didn’t know then, but she was just on the brink of what her life was\ngoing to be. Not yet though. All she knew now was that letting go was\nnot an option. It hurt, this tightly wound posture she maintained, hands\nof her past pulling at her shoulders, her head cycling between looking\nback and facing life’s momentum. She had yet to stand up, but in due\ntime she would — grab the wrists of the past and yank them forward with\nher.</p>\n<p>And from the bathroom floor, her grip unyielding, she cried, droplets\nand droplets of <i>I want I want I want</i>.</p>\n</div>","group":"writing"},"poison":{"title":"Poison","page":"<div class=story>\n\t\t<h2>Poison</h2>\n\t\t<span class=story-date>October 13, 2022</span>\n\t\t<hr><p>The rain in Taiwan liked drama. It was only after an afternoon of\nair-rippling hotness that water would come down in boatloads, landing on\nthe paved streets with reverberating cracks. There really was nothing to\ndo as a seven-year-old in a foreign country on those afternoons except\nto lay around and eat mangoes until my belly swelled with happiness.\nDinner would roll around on the kind of soft grey clouds that tumbled\nout of thunderstorms, and I would be compelled to set the table, scoop\nthe rice, hoist chairs from the other rooms. The smell of food would\nstifle any of my lingering jet lag and the door would swivel open and\nclose for my myriad of cousins. They floated in and out like anxious\nsailboats — momentarily returning to a safe harbor before bounding back\nto choppy seas. We would crowd around the table that was strewn across a\ngiant ledge in the room, insulated from the percussive Taipei streets,\nmy aunt’s gossip evoking scandalous gasps from everyone, even the most\nstoic uncle, and my grandfather’s one-thousandth retelling of his\nteenage hijinks causing us to double over in hopeless giggles.</p>\n<p>Like the droplets left over from the rain, ever-forming into mounds\nand pulled down by gravity, these moments, they grabbed me by the wrist\nand planted deep into what I know as those rose-tinged years —\n“nostalgia”. When I sit in the parking lot, waiting forever to be picked\nup from school and I catch the word “childhood” escape from someone’s\nmouth, I would think back to the endless platters of fruit oozing with\nsweetness and the laughter only experienced with those who shared the\nsame blood. But there was also something else. It lurked between the\nwindow panes and beneath the trees stirring in the dark; it was like a\nlong, mourning cry, like dead waters stinking in a ditch. Something in\nthe rain eclipsed all my moral soundness, and it had led me to do bad\nthings.</p>\n<p>Da Yin was everybody’s favorite cousin. She had eyes that were prone\nto scrunch when smiling, and a big, laughing mouth. Da Yin got good\ngrades. Not the best, but good enough for a girl, said all the\nrelatives. She always helped when you asked her to. Her thick black hair\nwas always readily swooshed into a low ponytail — pretty, but out of the\nway. Every morning I remember making the twenty-minute trek to the\napartment she resided in, brick pavement straddling a road lined with\ncoconut trees, the air still sticky from the smell of late-night\nskewers. After a sharp turn into an alleyway not far from the Temple, I\nwould find myself at her apartment, where anything imaginable, from old\nmail to dirty food containers occupied its floor, where everything was\ncoated in a layer of clammy, tropical dust. Her dad, my uncle, was a\nlean, sallow man who had a back stiffly curved from years of dreaming up\ndifferent business ventures that all ran into the ground with a\nresounding thud. He sat near the front entrance playing video games next\nto a dirty fish tank and occasionally exported a long line of expletives\ninto the rest of the apartment.</p>\n<p>I would follow Da Yin around like a duckling, imitating her\nmannerisms, trying to do anything I could to make her eyes scrunch and\nforce laughter out of her big mouth. Sometimes I would even resort to\nsaying something stupid so that she would let out an exasperated sigh,\ncall me a silly foreigner, give me a poke on the shoulder, squeeze my\ncheeks, throw me up into the air with her strong arms and twirl me\naround like the princess young girls believed themselves to be. But\nthere was a hidden sharpness to Da Yin, moments when her mask slipped,\nand something lethal came out like smoke. Now looking back, her mask was\nmade of glass.</p>\n<p>“Can I try some?” I asked one afternoon when we were laying on the\nmattress in the middle of the living room. We had exhausted our\nafternoon itinerary of doodling, jumping rope, bad karaoke, and\nexperimenting with expired make up. So there I was, observing the wobbly\nceiling fan when Da Yin took out a package of Hawthorn berry candy, a\nsugary cylinder of dried fruit cut into thin slices.</p>\n<p>She nodded. “Of course, they don’t have stuff like this in\n<i>America</i>.”</p>\n<p>There definitely was hawthorn candy in the States. Da Yin always had\nwild notions of America. For me, it was just an endless stream of\nhomework and dance lessons. Taipei was freedom, away from my mom’s reign\nover my every second. She was off meeting with college friends,\nrecounting their “rebellious years”, years which she would try\ndesperately to keep me from entering, but I have inevitably stepped into\nnow.</p>\n<p>Da Yin peeled off the candy wrapper.  I could feel my eyes widen at\nDa Yin’s methodical hands, tearing the paper so that it came off into a\nperfect, fuzzy-edged spiral. The sweet roll of hawthorn and sugar\ntumbled out at once, falling on the mattress with a bounce.</p>\n<p>Without thinking, I reached for it, scooped it up, and swallowed the\nentire candy.</p>\n<p>Da Yin stood up from the mattress. Her bare feet landed in the narrow\nstrip of floor that was free from trash. “That was my last piece!”</p>\n<p>I looked at her, not yet grasping the serious situation I had\nstumbled into. I blurted out haphazardly, “I’m sorry Da Yin, I wasn’t\nthinking.”</p>\n<p>Da Yin yanked me by my shirt. My toes still grazed the mattress, but\nI was suspended in the air, hoisted up like a ragdoll.</p>\n<p>She unclenched my shirt and began moving about the room like an odd\nGodzilla variant as I stayed in a shocked stillness. Empty bottles were\nbeing knocked down by her slow pacing and newspapers crunched under her\nnarrow feet. I could tell she was fuming, but I was unsure how to\napproach this version of Da Yin I had never seen before.</p>\n<p>I resorted to bargaining.  “I can tell my mom to buy you more! Are\nthere different flavors? What kind do you like the most?”</p>\n<p>Da Yin turned to me. She did so slowly, which now in retrospect,\nseemed cruel to do to a child, to turn to them slowly as they watched on\nin terror.</p>\n<p>“I bought that candy with my own money!” Da Yin said, each word a\npunch, and she looked at me, her brows furrowed as if her forehead was\nmade of warm wax. She reached out one hand and grabbed my face. At that\nmoment, I realized that Da Yin possessed the sharpest nails in the\nentire world, almond-shaped and filed to perfection.</p>\n<p>“Spit it out!”</p>\n<p>I tried, I really did. Alas, the hawthorn candy was well on its way\nto being digested. But Da Yin only squeezed my face harder. I didn’t\nyell for help. We stayed there. I could hear the clacking of my uncle’s\ncomputer games from out in the hall. Time slowed. What I remember now is\nan eternity of her big, unmoving mouth, her nails that dug into my still\nround cheeks, her stare locking onto mine, a mixture of mischief and\nsomething insidious permeating her irises. She let go at some point and\nI instantly crumpled into a ball. I coughed out a weak apology, but she\nsimply strolled out of the room.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>The next few afternoons I spent rocking on my grandfather’s\nvine-woven chair, thinking about her. Like that chair, which was\nsecretly rotting from Taiwan’s tenacious humidity, the image of Da Yin\nturning towards me started to decompose, and its decaying debris\npunctuated my every thought. I became obsessed with her sharp nails and\nlaughing eyes, scared by her rage and power. I was too young to admit to\nmyself that, after such a blatant transgression, I wanted to go visit\nher again. So I tried to avoid her altogether at family dinners. I vowed\nto never catch any attention, to scoop rice with expert precision, set\ndown chopsticks like putting babies to sleep, hoist chairs completely\noff the ground as to prevent any screeching across the floor. But when I\nsaw her five days later, I was surprised to find that Da Yin’s rage had\nvanished like a summer thunderstorm.</p>\n<p>My mom had dragged me to Da Yin’s apartment to be babysat because she\ncould no longer stand me. I was like a little wraith according to her,\nghoulishly haunting each of her day trips and high school reunions,\ntwitching nervously, scratching my mosquito bites, incessantly asking\nher when the dessert was coming.</p>\n<p>I entered Da Yin’s living room as if the trash scattered about were\ngrenades, but I was met with a familiar smile and jingle of laughter. My\nmother exchanged pleasantries with Da Yin before leaving, her steps down\nthe stairs lighter now that she was free of me. Da Yin waited a few\nminutes before throwing me the biggest smile.</p>\n<p>“Do you want to go play outside?” she asked.</p>\n<p>I was relieved, happy. “Yes!”</p>\n<p>“Ok! I’m sorry but I have to do the laundry and finish my homework,\ndon’t leave the alley, and don’t tell your mom I let you play alone,”\nsaid Da Yin wiggling her eyebrows up and down.</p>\n<p>I nodded in earnest and then ran down the stairs, holding in a grin.\nI was almost unable to contain my excitement of having the old Da Yin\nback, pushing all my confusion and fear to the deepest part of my\nstomach.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Wang Wang was a boy who lived in an apartment that shared the same\nalleyway as Da Yin. He had chubby cheeks and spiky black hair that\nsprung from his perfectly round head. Every time I saw him, he was\nsweating — fat droplets rolling down the sides of his forehead, his\nbouncy tan skin twinkling in the sun. We became friends the way\nchildhood friends are made: him showing me his collection of toy\nairplanes and me showing him the assorted pins on my turquoise backpack.\nWang Wang and I would spend afternoons with chalk in one hand and peeled\nlychee in the other, rainbow dust and fruit juices creeping down our\nwrists.</p>\n<p>On that day, we saw who could sprint down the alleyway fastest, and\nafterwards Wang Wang invited me into his apartment as we were leaning\nagainst the apartments’ browned bricks, our muscles atrophied from that\nchildlike bullishness that pushed the body beyond its pain signals. I\nhad wondered aloud about what his home looked like before, so I guess\nthis was just the natural progression of our friendship.  Wang Wang\nrevealed to me on our walk up that he lived with his mom who was the\nhired help for a single dad and his daughter.  We came up the final\nflight of stairs and were faced with a tall white door with a pin pad.\nWang Wang entered a code and the door unlocked with a clack.</p>\n<p>“It’s so bright! Like out of a magazine,” I marveled as we gingerly\ncarried our shoes from the foyer to Wang Wang and his mother’s allotted\nroom. The apartment was in pristine shape. Every surface was\nmicroscopically clean and the air was thick with the smell of citrus\nflavored disinfectant.</p>\n<p>“Yeah, don’t touch anything,” Wang Wang warned. A grey severity had\npassed over his brows and he moved through the hall like a ghost passing\nover into the next life. I pursed my lips and followed suit.</p>\n<p>The apartment was a long L shape, equipped with big windows and tiled\nfloors. Maybe it was because I was just in Da Yin’s apartment, but I was\nmystified by the dichotomy between the two homes separated by only two\nwalls and an alleyway. We padded along, and the floor lowered from a\ntiled ledge to wood paneling that seemed older than the rest of the\napartment. This was where Wang Wang stayed with his mother.</p>\n<p>“The girl who lives here, her name is Pei Er,” Wang Wang said,\nclosing the door at the end of the hall. “She’s sick.”</p>\n<p>“What do you mean?” I inquired while looking around. Wang Wang lived\nin a shoebox with a window so narrow that the phrase “a sliver of glass”\nwould be better fit to describe it. A knife’s edge of afternoon gold\nlanded onto the one mattress where he sat, and it made his hair look\nlike it was on fire. The rest of the room was occupied by two plastic\nboxes of clothes and a shelf stacked with schoolbooks and canned\nfood.</p>\n<p>Wang Wang leaned in. I braced myself for what he was about to\ndivulge. “The world is poisonous to her.”</p>\n<p>I found myself confused.</p>\n<p>“She can’t eat most things, not even bananas,” Wang Wang explained.\n“She can’t even leave the house unless my Ma or her Ba goes with her. He\ntook her to Disney world last year, and this place called Singapore,”\nWang Wang said as if reciting an oral tradition. He lifted his hands as\nif holding a small box. “But when they travel, they have to bring a\nwhole case of pills.”</p>\n<p>I nodded. “So that’s why her house looks like a hospital.”</p>\n<p>Wang Wang agreed. “Sometimes we play hide and seek, she’s really good\nwith words so I let her name my airplanes.” Wang Wang had never let me\nname his airplanes before.</p>\n<p>“One day I’m going to be a doctor and help her get better,” Wang Wang\nsaid, bringing a closed fist to his chest. He said this with an\nearnestness only found in children. I felt something between curiosity\nand envy sneak up my throat.</p>\n<p>“Where is she? Is she home?” I asked. I had not noticed a trace of\ndust or living things when we had entered.</p>\n<p>“She’s in her room. Always sleeping. And my Ma has to nap with\nher.”</p>\n<p>“Well, if the whole world was poisonous to me, I would sleep all day\ntoo,” I said, trying to stretch my prepubescent empathy but only\nsucceeding at seeming like I did.</p>\n<p>He rolled his eyes and showed me a laminated list his mother had of\nall of Pei Er’s allergies. All nuts, milk, wheat, eggs, most fruit,\nshellfish, the list went on so long I wondered if Pei Er could eat\nanything at all. I looked out the “window” and noticed that it had\nstarted pouring outside. We pulled the one meager curtain closed and\nmade shadow puppets in the lamplight, telling ourselves stories while\ncloaked in artificial light, our imaginations so bizarre and silly we\nforgot about our mosquito-bitten legs.</p>\n<p>Before leaving, I tried to catch a glimpse of Pei Er through the\ncrack of a door. But all I could see were Wang Wang’s mother’s tired,\nsleeping arms. I reckoned Pei Er probably looked sunken and\nmalnourished, like one of those starving kids on National Geographic\nmagazines.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>I got back to Da Yin’s apartment before dinner. She decided that we\nwere going to walk back to my grandparents’ house for a free meal since\nshe was too tired to cook. At a crosswalk, I told Da Yin about Pei Er’s\ncontroversial existence as a final peace offering. I knew that she would\nlove it; Da Yin handled gossip like dough: kneading and molding it,\nwaiting for it to rise with suspense between her fingers before licking\nits golden crust with her own embellishments.</p>\n<p>“That’s so unfortunate,” she said, jutting out her right hip and\nresting her manicured hand on it.  “So she can’t even eat a hardboiled\negg?”</p>\n<p>“Yeah,” I said, all chipper. Pei Er was just a character in my head,\na sickly, mythical beast. All that had mattered was the glint in Da\nYin’s now-interested eyes.</p>\n<p>“You know, I think you should try to be friends with her,” Da Yin\nsuggested nonchalantly. “She’s probably lonely.”</p>\n<p>I nodded. I was busy looking at the people passing holding umbrellas\nof every color, each still adorned with water droplets that sputtered\nthe red from the traffic lights over the slick black streets. “Yeah\nmaybe, but she has Wang Wang, he likes her a lot.”</p>\n<p>Da Yin chuckled. She put her hand in my hair, brushing with her\nfingers and gripping their tangled ends before finally running them\nthrough completely.</p>\n<p>“But they do have a really pretty apartment. I bet she has nice\ntoys.” I offered, and then, I began to drone on about how nice Pei Er’s\nhome was, how I couldn’t spot even a pinch of dust. I glanced over, and\nI swore I saw knuckles tighten, the white of her bones against her\nalready pale skin. Da Yin clapped her hands together and the smack\nbrought me back to reality. “Hmmm, yes, I think we should bake her a\ncake! She must not get <i>any</i> good food!”</p>\n<p>“But she can only eat…” I paused; the list of allergens scrolled\nthrough my brain in a blur. “Water?!” I exclaimed. “Can we make a cake\nwith just water?”</p>\n<p>Da Yin stared straight ahead as she grabbed my hand to cross the\nstreet. “We’ll figure something out, that poor, poor girl.”</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>The next day I found Da Yin had materialized baking supplies from\nrubble, bowls and bags of unnamed ingredients stood erect, proud against\nthe slow decay her apartment cursed all its inhabitants with.</p>\n<p>Da Yin was muttering something from the pantry.</p>\n<p>“Mom made me fried taro pancakes with extra sauce for breakfast,” I\noffered this information as if it was interesting. “Did <i>you</i> make\nsomething Da Yin?”</p>\n<p>Da Yin walked out with a cake-like thing sleeping soundlessly in a\npan between her hands and multiple damp rags. “Yes, it’s for your\nfriend.”</p>\n<p>“Are you sure Da Yin?” I asked. I could hear my own voice carrying a\nnote of higher-pitched distrust.</p>\n<p>“Why not? I made it with special ingredients,” Da Yin replied. She\nwinked. I didn’t know how pretty someone could be until I saw her sharp\nlashes flick so effortlessly at me that morning.</p>\n<p>I nodded. But knowing what I know now, I can’t help but conjecture\nthat I had already grasped what was about to transpire, but I had chosen\nchildhood innocence, however artificial, over all else.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>I found Wang Wang outside in the alleyway with his airplane\ncollection nicely lined up on some crates. “Aren’t you scared someone is\ngoing to steal your planes?” I inquired.</p>\n<p>He looked downcast. Wang Wang had the blackest eyes, the kind where\nyou couldn’t tell where the iris ended, and the pupil started. Now they\nhad a watery shine that made me want to crouch down and catch their\nresidue with my hands.</p>\n<p>“I’m selling them, my Ma said I had to” he said. “I can give you a\ndiscount.</p>\n<p>I examined his collection for the thousandth time. I tried to cheer\nhim up. “Let’s make a poster! Or I can draw something with chalk?”</p>\n<p>Wang Wang’s eyes suddenly got very itchy, and he started to rub them,\nso I wrapped my bony arms around him,  our sweaty shirts sticking to\neach other, my mosquito bite scabs brushing against his.</p>\n<p>“Da Yin made cake,” I murmured into his ear. “She says it’s for Pei\nEr, but we can have some too.”</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Wang Wang’s mother was out on her weekly grocery run. Even then I\nknew that this was a good thing, that it would make things go easier. We\nknocked on Pei Er’s door.</p>\n<p>“Let’s just give her a small piece,” whispered Wang Wang, who was\nmaking eye contact with the cake.  He could hardly stop salivating.</p>\n<p>The door opened normally. For some reason I had imagined a dramatic\nswing accompanied by a slow and dreadful creak.</p>\n<p>“Who are you?” asked the girl who was Pei Er, looking straight at\nme.</p>\n<p>“I’m Wang Wang’s best friend,” I said, puffing up my chest. “We made\nyou a special cake.”</p>\n<p>I lifted the pan for her to examine as I examined her in return. She\nlooked completely normal and healthy. She brought her nose gingerly to\nthe cake, sniffing the yellow loaf.</p>\n<p>“Why is it special?” she asked. “Did my Ba say I can eat it?”</p>\n<p>Wang Wang crossed his arms. “It’s special because you <i>can</i> eat\nit. Her cousin made sure of it. Da Yin’s a nurse.”</p>\n<p>She wasn’t. I don’t know how Wang Wang came to this conclusion, but I\nthink it was because he saw Da Yin measure my temperature once in her\nstrange, methodical way.</p>\n<p>Pei Er smiled. “It smells delicious!”</p>\n<p>We crowded around the breakfast table, our feet dangling off the\nhighchairs, looking like a huddle of little adults. Pei Er scooped some\ncake straight out of the pan with a spoon. It looked perfectly moist,\nglistening with melted sugar. She stuffed the cake into her mouth.</p>\n<p>“This…” Pei Er paused. She closed her eyes. “Is the best thing I have\never had.”</p>\n<p>Wang Wang gulped, hunger in his eyes. “Can I try some?”</p>\n<p>Pei Er offered him her spoon and he tried some too, his eyes widening\nas he chewed. All he could do was nod. I giggled. I grabbed some cake\nwith my hand. Pei Er followed suit. Before we knew it, the three of us\nwere covered in cake, smeared with its sugary goodness.</p>\n<p>I still don’t know what happened first. Either Pei Er fell off her\nchair gripping at her neck, or Wang Wang’s mom came sprinting straight\nto the kitchen, squeaky clean vegetables wrapped in plastic and\nStyrofoam flying out of her hands.  All I remember is Pei Er’s face\nturning blue, the word “water” escaping her pink mouth. I remember\nturning to her and smiling. I could feel my own bizarre ecstasy, my\nblood boiling. An apparition of Da Yin’s big mouth spreading into a grin\nappeared and I felt my smile growing wider parallel to hers. I made sure\nto remain unblinking. Pei Er’s thin voice grew thinner until she looked\nlike a fish out of water, her mouth gaping in open air, her small\ncontractions slowing into stillness. I remember Wang Wang leaping out of\nhis chair and panickily shaking her shoulders, trying to rid her of the\npoison we dealt with smiling faces.</p>\n<p>“I’m sorry, please Pei Er,” Wang Wang said through the streams of\nmucus running down his face like a freshly thawed mountain stream. “I’m\nsorry, I’m sorry, I’m so sorry.”</p>\n<p>Unlike when I was in Da Yin’s apartment with the candy down my\nthroat, <i>I</i> was the one with the luxury to gawk. Some time passed,\nand I felt my voyeurism sliced into two when Wang Wang’s mother shot me\na murderous glare. I ran as fast as I could out of the apartment, down\nthe concrete steps and into the thundering city, where rain shot down\nlike bullets, bright blue lightning crawling above through the shifting\ngreys and blacks of the sky. I ran all the way back to my grandparents’\nhouse, where I was interrogated. I returned each probe with a steady\nanswer, the monkey in my brain finding itself more civilized than it had\never been.</p>\n<p>What happened with Pei Er or Wang Wang is still a mystery to me, but\nI still turn over these events in my head like loose soil above a\ncasket, unable to finally bury what could not rest.  I only see Da Yin\nnow when I scroll through Facebook. She cut her hair at some point,\nblunt ends now hit her chin — it looked good, the style suited her.\nApparently she had given birth to a healthy daughter. She is laughing in\nall her pictures. But still, the Da Yin steeped in summer rain, the Da\nYin that brewed my childhood, is imprinted in my mind. I see the slow\nturning of her head towards me, but I never really see her face because\nin its place would always be my own.</p>\n</div>","group":"writing"},"greys-gift":{"title":"Grey's Gift","page":"<div class=story>\n\t\t<h2>Grey's Gift</h2>\n\t\t<span class=story-date>Spring 2022</span>\n\t\t<hr><p>All that could be felt by Grey spun itself into thread, which she\nwould parse through using her fingers and try to make sense of, but,\nlike a mortal attempting to cipher the threads of fates, never was she\nsuccessful. Ring! The telephone invaded her thoughts, but as Grey\nreached for the receiver, she remembered that she had yet to go to the\npost office, where it should be! A package — heavy and wrapped with\nthick yellow paper and a little tightening of twine — she could hear its\nsolid, crumpling sound as she opened it. And the bright feeling she was\nbound to board and soar on when the sight of the gift entered her eyes!\nBut alas, the voice of the phone spoke:</p>\n<p>“Courtney, how are you, I have been thinking of you, but something\nhas prevented me from calling you…” her mother rambled as Grey began\nrolling a thin strip of paper that was lying limp on her desk into a\ntight spiral. Her mother’s voice, a soft, weak siren, came in and out of\nits deep waters, and Courtney began her journey to the post office. She\ncould picture the blue of the sky, and from her mind’s eye, Grey could\nsee two people wearing bright yellow jackets. How serendipitous?! That\ntwo unrelated people would head out their doors from different corners\nof the city with the same piercing shade painted on their backs. The\nevent pleased her, and it made Grey wonder about the odds of her life,\nand the odds of the giver of her gift. A strong inflection in the still\nwaters of her mother’s incantations drew her back, pulling Grey’s\nopinionated chin from the window to the curvature of the receiver.</p>\n<p>“Oh Court! You really should’ve married him when you had the chance.\nAnne is going to have another baby, and Louis is the best of fathers,”\nshe said.</p>\n<p>Grey always thought her mother talked in a rather wasteful way —\nEdwina Moore threw words carelessly and strung them together with proper\nsyntax and impeccable drama, but failed to find a majestical spine that\nwould connect a beast’s appendages, into something meaningful…\nworthwhile. And so it lay limp around her, pieces to revel at,\ndismembered and bloody. A day thirty years ago shot through Grey’s mind.\nGrey — Courtney rather, yes she was Courtney then — would stand at the\nedge of the tulip bed, as her mother would fret and spin around her,\nlike a wild panther, while her words confusingly clawed at her. Either\nher dress was not spotless, or she spoke too loudly at supper, or her\nFrench was not up to the tastes of the other Edwinas of society. Grey\nlet these memories pass, but the indignance they once held left a tremor\nin her small heart.</p>\n<p>“I do believe I have quite a few errands to run,” Grey started. Like\na hawk she tried to find a point where she could exit, to dive away, to\nget back to the steady ground of her life. <i>Wasn’t the notion insane?\nOne’s own life. How could you own something that you had no business\npurchasing at the market.</i>  </p>\n<p>“But I’ve barely just spoken to you, and I have not told you what\nthey were saying about you today when I went to the department store\nyesterday,” Mrs. Moore protested.</p>\n<p>Grey sighed, the paper that she had been rolling had wasted away into\na thin string of fibre, and she could feel the pattern of its motion on\nher fingertips. Her sigh must have been extraordinarily audible, because\nEdwina Moore began again in a sharper tone. Grey could see her brown\ncurls, once tinted with red, now with grey, but still glistening with\nthe resilience of the wife of a parliamentarian. They shone towards her\nwith a blinding light, and Grey squeezed her eyelids together as her\nmother’s phantom wrapped around her head.</p>\n<p>“Courtney, I do not care about your errands, I am actually calling\nyou because of your concerning disposition, and as your mother I deserve\nat least that,” said Edwina Moore. “Please tell me you have at least\nmade yourself useful this past summer, Mrs. Lowe told me you had stopped\ngoing to the charity dinners on Sunday.”</p>\n<p>Grey assured her mother that all was well, that her head had been\nbothering her, that everything but the monkey in her that makes\ndecisions had been plotting against her. Her mother accepted her excuses\none by one like a boy holding out a basket to an apple-picker. The call\nwas finished — at last — Grey leapt out into the summer air like a\nsalmon bounding upstream.</p>\n<p>Eyes, in all shades of possible plumage: green, sapphire, the deepest\nshade of brown, hid under neatly arranged sun caps and umbrellas. Grey\nwas one for peering, and she did. Oh dear! Did anyone look at her? She\nwanted it, others’ eyes, and yet she did not know what she would do with\nthem, other than take them to the ocean to watch the waves lap back and\nforth, and throw them into the soft dunes. What was she? A grain of\nsand? She did feel rather granular as the sun began its descent,\npixelating details, shrinking her down, making her a point, a bee in a\nfield, a boat in a bay. It was a bearable feeling, this shrinking, but\nit was also unequally unbearable  — she was devastated. She wanted\nexpansion, to grow big and devour and take from the world. Her chest\ntightened and constricted. <i>Not now!</i> <i>Look around you!</i> Look\nat the children, the dogs, the splendour of flowers spilling in\nabundance.</p>\n<p>These risings and lowerings came over her whenever she headed to the\npost office. A bashful encounter, a triumphant day of errands, an\nangering conversation beneath polite words, they flitted through her\nlike endless jolts of waves washing up and over, drawing in, drawing\nback, towards Rome and then out to the horizon.</p>\n<p>But what was the use of these wonderings when she was about to\nreceive her gift? It was from Joanne. Joanne, the star in her night sky,\nthe Joanne whose lips were always painted red. “I love you,” she had\nsaid with those lips one night. Like a spell, those words have governed\nGrey’s life from the moment they spilt into the world. But Joanne was\nnot here, she was in the painful “there”, a place Grey could only\nunderstand but could only touch when she unravelled the brown parcels\nshe was sacredly allotted. <i>Was that enough</i>, Grey often wondered.\nYes! She shouted it from rooftops. No! She thought to herself one late\nnight pouring herself a cup of warm milk in the kitchen. To be held,\nthat was too much one could ask for! And yet it was also all she had\never wanted.</p>\n<p>Grey’s shoes hit the pavement like beats from a metronome. She could\nfeel it — Paris, Joanne’s home — getting closer. The summers she would\nspend there “studying art”, swinging from one cafe to another wrapped in\nher mother’s silks. Grey swore she could hear those dense afternoons\nunder the sun, as the heat of it all exploded into storms around 4\no’clock, just to be brought up again into a frenzy by night bugs and\ntheir orchestral melodies.</p>\n<p>There stood the post office, on stout legs of brick, sporting a pair\nof dashing white windows looking out onto the busy street. Grey liked\nits posture, how neat it was, how the shrubbery was arranged around it,\nhow no unnecessary accessories poked out sorely. Grey lifted her skirt.\nShe carried herself up the steps like that of an altar, as if she was a\nsacrificial lamb — about to offer herself to Joanne, to decades of\nwaiting before a lonely grave. She turned the door knob. It was shut.\nShe tries again. Never did words hurt her so more than the sign that\npressed itself up against the window: CLOSED.  <i>How dare they keep her\nfrom her?</i> A drop of rain theatrically lands on her cap, as if the\nperiod to the death sentence Grey felt hanging above the nape of her\nneck. <i>What if she had married, what if the love she had chosen was\nnot worthy of the fortune of time she spent on it.</i> She grasped onto\na nearby railing, the red rust crunching into her fine gloves, and her\nfine gloves becoming inkish under the accelerating rain — it was all\nbecoming a single blur. This is real, <i>she was not dreaming</i>, only\nthat it felt immoral that her gift was somewhere in “there”, on some\nhardy table, and here she was, on the steps, a fake devotee, a phoney,\nnothing at all.</p>\n<p>She stood at the door above the street, back erect and chin still\nsharp, but she seemed so small. One could see from the house across the\nstreet, a lady, two and forty, hidden beneath the armour of a black\ngown, arms mechanically crossed like a nutcracker. And what was in her\neyes? The defensiveness of an animal backed into a corner, the hardness\nof someone who has lived in a room of her own, the wicked brilliance of\na narrow creek that managed to carve a path for herself. Grey peered in\none last time, into the dark of the closed post office. She could make\nout a golden outline now that the sun was halfway down the horizon,\ntaking its last breath, exhaling soft rays into the office, diffused,\nspreading about. The brain did not matter at all! Grey can feel it, she\nwas the thread being woven, and time, forever headed in one direction\nwhile immovable in the other, was finally within her grasp. She was no\nlonger parsing, with glimpses of truth bestowing upon her. But she too\nwas that divine hand. She could see it now. In the back, on a shelf — it\nsat like an Emperor: a glorious, brown package. <i>That</i> was\nJoanne’s, <i>that</i> was hers. <i>Theirs</i>. She was sure of it. And\nshe will be back tomorrow.</p>\n</div>","group":"writing"},"about-artist":{"title":"About Artist","page":"<div><h2>About Artist</h2></div><div id=\"about-pictures\">\n<img src=media/profile/1.webp><img src=media/profile/2.webp>\n</div>\n<p>Jolinna Li is a filmmaker based in Charlottesville, Virginia.
