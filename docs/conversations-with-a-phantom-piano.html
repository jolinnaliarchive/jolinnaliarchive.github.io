the piano bench. There was no piano, but she runs herfingers along imaginary keys anyways. There are broken skylight windowsabove her, and from them, light shoots down white and harsh, making asplintery mess. Her fingers dance and she sways a little with them, herknuckles coming in and out of the skylight’s illumination. She isn’tpressing the keys — she is swimming through them, as if ripping theinstrument apart to make a new kind of music.</p><p>It is a warm day. Small birds peck at the grass growing where thewalls meet the earth. The space had lost its interior timbre, all of theghosts having escaped through the cracks of the concrete walls. It usedto be a high school cafeteria, back before schools integrated. This wasthe colored school that got shut down. Now, forest sounds permeate theair. Things have settled for the last time. Anya settles too, her pieceover. She can hear the Huntingdon kids creeping in, wearing their dresspants and plaid skirts, white button downs ironed by their grandmas andnannies. She moves to a corner obscured by tall rusty carts that wouldmake a lot of sound if knocked over.</p><p>“This is our kingdom,” the girl with the short hair says. Anya knowsthat her name is Heather Smith. She can see her shuffling around therubble along with the other two kids, a bunch of dandelions limp in hercoat pocket.</p><p>“Are you the king? Are we your subjects?” asks the tall boy — Rory.He was probably the one who picked the dandelions.</p><p>Heather reaches out her hand. Her slender arm makes the perfect linefrom her shoulder to her fingertips. Rory bends down, smelling her skin;he kisses her hand. Anya cannot imagine being touched in such an openway.</p><p>Dash, the short boy, his name short for Richard Dashner, shakes hishead to himself. “Rory be careful, I swear if she tells you to jump offa bridge all you’ll do is ask how high.”</p><p>Heather snorts. Rory is unfazed. “That’s so silly Dash, I wouldn’task questions. I’d just jump.”</p><p>Dash shakes his head in disbelief. They sit on the ground, Heatherand Rory back to back, reading two copies of the same book. Anya likesthe sliver of space between their lower part of their backs, lightstreaming through them and around them. She thinks they look like a pairof wings. Dash lays out flat beside Rory with his own book lying facedown between pages on his chest. He lights a cigarette and startssucking it. Anya watches the puffs of grey escape his mouth, irregularshapes that expand until they disappear. She knows, that even watchinghim from a distance, she could watch his mouth moving forever, lopsided,like he was hiding something in its asymmetry.</p><p>“What are you reading?” asked Heather suddenly. Rory looksinquisitively at his book which was the same as hers, but then realizesthe question was directed at Dash. Dash takes a second to realize thistoo. He turns his head up to the side.</p><p>“Crime and Punishment,” he says.</p><p>“Thinking about murdering anybody recently and then embarking a questof moral quandary?” says Heather</p><p>“Ha! Why would I kill anyone? There’s no need,” replies Dash.</p><p>“Well that’s only if you get caught. Doesn’t the guy in the booknever get caught?” asks Rory.</p><p>“To be simply put, I don’t think I’d pull it off,” says Dash. “Also,he totally gets caught. I’m at that part now.”</p><p>“I think someone pulled it off quite recently,” says Rory.</p><p>His words hit Dash’s brows. Anya sees every tendon in his bodytighten.</p><p>“That girl with the glasses. Some unique trailer trash,” continuesRory. “Can’t even drive.”</p><p>“I don’t know what Dr. Palmer saw in her, letting her come toHuntingdon. I’ll admit, she can play the piano … but nobody knew whatwas going on in that big head of hers,” says Heather.</p><p>Dash stays quiet but exaggeratedly opens his book, obscuring his facefrom Anya — the world. He begins reading and and the three are submergedup to their shoulders in silence.</p><p>The ground Anya sits on is damp. She can feel the water going throughher jeans, her underwear. But she likes the coolness in the dark corner,seeming to have been there for ages. It felt safe. Anya scoots againstthe wall, feels the dampness spread across her shoulder blades. Shecloses her eyes.</p><p><i>What piece were you playing?</i></p><p>Nothing in particular.</p><p><i>What was the song?</i></p><p>There wasn’t a song. It was just me pretending to play the piano.</p><p><i>But I could really feel it, you know?  Like there were vibrationsyou were putting out.</i></p><p>Thanks.</p><p><i>You should teach someone.</i></p><p>I did. Why are you asking me this?</p><p><i>Because I think it would help me understand what you were playing,the reason why I exist.</i></p><p>You don’t exist. I was just waving my hands around.</p><p><i>You said you were pretending to play the piano. I am the piano.Albeit a pretend piano. Did they quit?</i></p><p>What?</p><p><i>The person you taught.</i></p><p>Not by choice.</p><p><i>Does it have something to do with the kids over there?</i></p><p>Yes… obliquely. Not really. Only Dash.</p><p><i>You were what they were talking about.</i></p><p>Maybe…</p><p><i>What happened?</i></p><p>Sometimes you don’t even know you’ve memorized a piece and then yougo somewhere without the sheet music and you stumble upon a piano andyou just start playing and it’s, it’s, it’s…</p><p><i>Muscle memory?</i></p><p>Yeah, but it scares me.</p><p><i>What?</i></p><p>How the body remembers. I haven’t touched an actual piano since.</p><p><i>Ha! An actual piano! That hurts!</i></p><p>You’re not even real.</p><p><i>Hmph…</i></p><p><i>…What does your body remember?</i></p><p>My eyes, they remember how they were pierced as I exited the dimlylit store and out into the parking lot. I could feel the heat from thepavement through my sandals as I padded to my car.  My lips still wetfrom kissing. I remember the metal of my car door stinging my skin.  Mynose remembers the smell of piss. I can feel him between my arms, hisskin lifeless in dead air.</p><p><i>And he was the one you taught to play?</i></p><p>Yes.</p><p><i>Was he good?</i></p><p>He was ok, he always asked me for skittles after our lesson. He had araspy little voice. He liked scales, hated chords. His hands were toosmall.</p><p><i>So he died.</i></p><p>Yes, but that was not the worst part.</p><p><i>How could it get any worse that that?</i></p><p>Things always get worse. Especially when you think you hit rockbottom.</p><p><i>But how do you get to ‘rock bottom’? Do you fall, do you loweryourself gently?</i></p><p>Maybe. It’s interesting that you say “lower yourself”. I thought itwasn’t something you can get to yourself, but a combination of externalfactors. But I think it is very possible to self-inflict. So you knowthe concept of up and down?</p><p><i>Yes. Up is silence, down is the opposite of that. Down is melodic.Down is pressure — presence, solid.</i></p><p>Then imagine rock bottom as infinite sound, like that siren that rangafter the worst finally happened, the siren that would stay in my earsthe days after. It’s so solid it’s like a giant finger pressing on yourchest.</p><p><i>Anya. We must start at the beginning, the bottom is where theanswers are. But I do not know the questions.</i></p><p>Yes, we must start at the beginning.</p><p><i>The answers are infinite, but they converge at the question, atthe beginning. Yes, let’s go there, to the beginning.</i></p><p>I no longer think about the beginning, because it makes me feel thepassing seconds so much more. I am hurting every second. I am being duginto. I will not be forgiven.</p><p><i>what is it to be forgiven?</i></p><p>It’s when you tell someone that wronged you that you have processedit and that you accept them as a person.</p><p><i>So they can’t accept you. You feel like you’ve beenexiled.</i></p><p>I think they don’t want to process it either. It’s beyond the realmof things they want to deal with. They have other things to worryabout.</p><p><i>Like what?</i></p><p>Cruises. Business deals. Their pet tigers. The kids are now thinkingabout prom. What dress to wear. The girls with curly hair want theirhair straightened, the girls with straight hair want their haircurled.</p><p><i>I still don’t understand.</i></p><p>What?</p><p><i>Why do you need to be forgiven?</i></p><p>Because I can’t go on feeling like I owe those people, who I alreadyowed so much to, I am knee deep in indebtedness. I can’t believe themoral superiority that boiled underneath my skin, when I have done anirrevocable act. And they don’t even know the truth.</p><p><i>This must have something to do with the song you’ve beenplaying.</i></p><p>Maybe.</p><p><i>I need to know the song.</i></p><p>Ok. The beginning?</p><p><i>Yes, Anya. Let’s start there.</i></p><p>I guess it would have to start with Dr. Palmer. He approached meafter my first recital when we got to Georgia, he said I should apply toHuntingdon. That I was too good for public school. His hair was oiledand he smelled like pine trees. He told me and my mom that he thought Iwas an angel and that he actually liked my hair.</p><p>“It’s so black and shiny?!” he had noted.</p><p>My mom was so relieved someone wanted to talk to us, she may havenodded too vigorously. I noticed that he was annoyed with her, hereagerness. I secretly laughed at her in my head too because I hated howshe wanted to be a part of something so badly. Like our family wasn’tenough for her, she had to be in a continuous state of expansion. Sheconsumed so much, she kept up with everything —  the latest fashion,beauty products, omega-3 supplements, after school programs for giftedkids. My mom is the kind of mom that spent a whole day cleaning when sheheard guests were coming over. I thought it was stupid. No matter howmuch you clean a trailer you’re still in a trailer. She would sit on thesofa across from the keyboard when I played and take notes. And then shewould make me play in front of her friends. She felt entitled to it, mytalent. A flick of her wrist pulled me out of whatever I was doing andonto the piano bench.</p><p><i>But you like playing piano, no?</i></p><p>Yes.</p><p><i>So it’s thanks to her.</i></p><p>Well, not for a while. For a while I hated it. But I guess if we’retalking about beginnings she is the start of everything. My life. Mypain. My love.</p><p><i>So that is what I am made of, your pain and love. Tell me aboutDash.</i></p><p>Nobody talked to me at Huntingdon about anything other than meperforming at their aunt’s wedding or how good I was at playing piano.But the first time I met Dash he told me my glasses were crooked.</p><p><i>Were they?</i></p><p>Yes. He’s very honest.</p><p><i>Do you find honesty important?</i></p><p>I don’t know. I don’t think my mom strived for me to have an honestpersonality. I’ve been building something inside me.</p><p><i>What have you been building?</i></p><p>This wall, I can’t be myself no matter how hard I try. I am either onthe wall looking down at people, or I’m down below with thisinsurmountable thing before me. No matter how hard I try I am fallingfrom the top but simultaneously stuck at the bottom. Condescending yetimmobile.</p><p><i>What does Dash have to do with this?</i></p><p>I was answering your question about honesty.</p><p><i>But this isn’t about that either, is it?</i></p><p>Yeah isn’t that what life is? Extrapolating meaning frommeaninglessness. If you do it too much it hurts.</p><p><i>Extrapolate it.</i></p><p>What?</p><p><i>What does Dash have to do with the wall?</i></p><p>He was like a gate. I could go through the wall if I was with him. Helent me books. He would kiss me on the cheek. In a soft kind of way.</p><p><i>But?</i></p><p>But…but he only kissed me in the one corner of the library that noone could see. He didn’t let me talk to Rory or Heather. I was likehis…</p><p><i>His pet?</i></p><p>Well, that’s an exaggeration. The problem was probably just that Ithought about him too much.</p><p><i>Anya, you’re not making sense. How do we get to the car and thepiss?</i></p><p>Dash let me borrow his camera, for an art project. I decided that Iwould go around the rich suburban homes and take pictures of them. I wasa fan of bird baths and garden gnomes.</p><p>I had been staying up pretty late. I was memorizing so many pieces atthat time. I was a walking gramophone. I knew all the cheesy weddingpieces, like Canon in D. I could play that one in my sleep. There wasalso the kid I was teaching piano to at that time. Louis. He had fatcheeks, cherub-like. His pale face was always slightly flushed, eitherfrom running outside or from napping way too long. His mom treated himlike a teddy bear, her tight embrace following him wherever he went. Shewas the President of the Garden Bookclub, and my mom delegated me withthe task of teaching Louis piano with the hope that she would eventuallybe invited to join the ensemble of rich housewives.</p><p><i>Was she?</i></p><p>No. I don’t think they even talk to her anymore, not after whathappened.</p><p>It was the Sunday before the week the project was due, and I headedout early to take the pictures.</p><p>The trailer was quiet. It was a long box with linoleum surfaces anduneven floors. But the floors were always clean. I like walking barefooton them, feeling the protrusions and divots beneath me. Dawn crept inthrough the plastic blinders and spilled onto the surfaces, drawingyellow hemispheres over the countertops. I grabbed the camera and tookthe car. I thought I would be back by noon so my mother wouldn’tnotice.</p><p>The first house I went to was modern and painted black. It had blueshutters and abstract statues that looked like ginormous columns ofseaweed. I could see a young family through the crystal clear window,toys spilled over a carpeted floor, a woman dressed her Sunday best. Isnapped a picture and moved on.</p><p>I kept walking down the street, some houses were more traditionallooking, stone walls and castle-like. I come across this green houseshrouded by trees. I notice the outline of what seemed to be a giantbird between the crossing branches. I wanted to get a closer look so Iwalked along the white fence on the edge of the yard. I knew I wastrespassing, but I thought that whoever lived there might be already atchurch, so there was no harm. I would just get the picture and go.</p><p>But then I saw. It was the Huntingdon kids. Rory and Heather and someother people I didn’t know but would snicker at me in the hallways. Theywere surrounded by beasts. That huge bird, rainbow and magnificent.Tigers, zebras, peacocks. The animals seemed subdued, completely tame,while the kids pulled at their fur and ears, little gods in a garden ofeden. Some music was playing in the background, faint but pulsing; andthe flora matched the fauna with its vigor and exoticism. Fans of green,blossoms of pink, primordial vines, all draped on the big chestnut treesover a perfectly kept lawn. It didn’t smell like animals, instead, anintoxicating fragrance permeated the air.</p><p>I looked at their tea cups. And I swear—</p><p><i>What?</i></p><p>There were bones in them. Small bones.</p><p>I stood there, feeling like the dumbest person in the world, and thenI snapped a picture. Right then, Anya must have noticed me because Iremember her raising her perfect hand, admonishing me. I felt acrackling in my temples and I turned and ran. I ran faster than I haveever run in my life. I knew something bad was about to happen.</p><p>I got into my car and hit the gas. I drove straight to Louis’ house.I knew that sometimes his mom would let him sleep in while she went tochurch. I knocked on the door, he opened it after peeping through thewindow.</p><p>“Hi Anya!” he squealed, clearly awake.</p><p>“I’m gonna take you somewhere fun!” I said, scooping him up in myarms.</p><p>We got to the store, the one that offered to print pictures. I wantedto print the picture immediately. I did not know what I would do withit, but I knew it would give me something those kids already had. Butwhen I entered the store, Dash was already there.</p><p>“Anya, give me the camera.”</p><p>“No, the project’s due in two days, let me print the pictures.”</p><p>Dash gave me a long look. “They told me you trespassed.”</p><p>“Just let me print the pictures.”</p><p>“I can’t let you do that Anya.”</p><p>“I love you.”</p><p>He grabbed my arm and took the camera from me. I thought about Louisin my car, the skittles I gave him probably smeared and melting over hiscute little face. I kissed Dash right then. I moved my hand under hisshirt, felt his chest. I thought about my mother, what she wanted, andthen I knew I had to destroy it. We stayed there for a small eternity,making sketches of each other with our hands, tracing the edges of ourbacks.</p><p>Finally, I looked up at him.</p><p>“I like how your eyes look,” he said, no. He whispered it.“Bewitching.”</p><p>That’s when I shoved him. I shoved him so hard I heard him cry out inpain. I grabbed the camera.</p><p><i>And then that’s when you stepped outside and the hotness hit, andLouis was gone?</i></p><p>Yes. I just got in the car anyways. I just drove. I refused to lookat the backseat, where Louis was slumped over. I didn’t know where togo. I just kept driving. I couldn’t stop. I broke out of my trance whenI saw Dash driving behind me. Then I started noticing two other cars Ihad seen in the school parking lot before.</p><p><i>And then?</i></p><p>And then…</p><p><i>There was the crash, wasn’t there? And then… Louis</i></p><p>gone.</p><p><i>The car</i></p><p>gone.</p><p><i>The camera</i></p><p>gone.</p><p><br></p><p><i>So I went to the beginning, and I’ve reached the crash</i></p><p>Is that it? Is that the end of the story?</p><p><i>Maybe, maybe not. I guess that is why I am here. I have to decide,is this the end for me?</i></p><p>What was the song I was playing?</p><p><i>A song for your mother, for Dash. The things you can’t say. A songthat isn’t finished.</i></p><p>I thought you were here to find out why you exist.</p><p><i>Anya — I’m the part of you that makes up a sad talking pianobecause you are all alone. The part of you that keeps on making melodieseven though you haven’t seen sheet music in a month. The part of youthat wonders why you had to pick up Louis. The part of you thatunderstands why you did anyways. He was your backup plan. But you go on,you pick up your things and you run. From the perfect lawns and neathedges, with a camera in your hand. With pictures of things you can’texplain but know too well. What will I do now?</i></p><p>Anya stands. Her shirt is drenched. She knocks down the cart oftrays, they make a sound that thunders against the walls and rattles theearth.</p><p>“What the fuck?” Rory says peering up from his book. Dash looksstraight at Anya, eyes wide.</p><p>“Wait is that?” Heather turns too. Her pale eyes adjust to the darkcorner. “It’s that cunt.”</p><p>Anya walks over, she raises two fingers to her eyes, she turns themand draws a line from herself to them. An invisible line, as fantasticaland solid as her phantom piano.</p></div></div></body><script>const short_base = 'conversations-with-a-phantom-piano'</script><script src="./d3.v7.min.js"></script><script src="./d3-dispatch@3.js"></script><script src="./d3-quadtree@3.js"></script><script src="./d3-timer@3.js"></script><script src="./d3-force@3.js"></script><script src=script.js></script>
