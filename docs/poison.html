It was only after an afternoon ofair-rippling hotness that water would come down in boatloads, landing onthe paved streets with reverberating cracks. There really was nothing todo as a seven-year-old in a foreign country on those afternoons exceptto lay around and eat mangoes until my belly swelled with happiness.Dinner would roll around on the kind of soft grey clouds that tumbledout of thunderstorms, and I would be compelled to set the table, scoopthe rice, hoist chairs from the other rooms. The smell of food wouldstifle any of my lingering jet lag and the door would swivel open andclose for my myriad of cousins. They floated in and out like anxioussailboats — momentarily returning to a safe harbor before bounding backto choppy seas. We would crowd around the table that was strewn across agiant ledge in the room, insulated from the percussive Taipei streets,my aunt’s gossip evoking scandalous gasps from everyone, even the moststoic uncle, and my grandfather’s one-thousandth retelling of histeenage hijinks causing us to double over in hopeless giggles.</p><p>Like the droplets left over from the rain, ever-forming into moundsand pulled down by gravity, these moments, they grabbed me by the wristand planted deep into what I know as those rose-tinged years —“nostalgia”. When I sit in the parking lot, waiting forever to be pickedup from school and I catch the word “childhood” escape from someone’smouth, I would think back to the endless platters of fruit oozing withsweetness and the laughter only experienced with those who shared thesame blood. But there was also something else. It lurked between thewindow panes and beneath the trees stirring in the dark; it was like along, mourning cry, like dead waters stinking in a ditch. Something inthe rain eclipsed all my moral soundness, and it had led me to do badthings.</p><p>Da Yin was everybody’s favorite cousin. She had eyes that were proneto scrunch when smiling, and a big, laughing mouth. Da Yin got goodgrades. Not the best, but good enough for a girl, said all therelatives. She always helped when you asked her to. Her thick black hairwas always readily swooshed into a low ponytail — pretty, but out of theway. Every morning I remember making the twenty-minute trek to theapartment she resided in, brick pavement straddling a road lined withcoconut trees, the air still sticky from the smell of late-nightskewers. After a sharp turn into an alleyway not far from the Temple, Iwould find myself at her apartment, where anything imaginable, from oldmail to dirty food containers occupied its floor, where everything wascoated in a layer of clammy, tropical dust. Her dad, my uncle, was alean, sallow man who had a back stiffly curved from years of dreaming updifferent business ventures that all ran into the ground with aresounding thud. He sat near the front entrance playing video games nextto a dirty fish tank and occasionally exported a long line of expletivesinto the rest of the apartment.</p><p>I would follow Da Yin around like a duckling, imitating hermannerisms, trying to do anything I could to make her eyes scrunch andforce laughter out of her big mouth. Sometimes I would even resort tosaying something stupid so that she would let out an exasperated sigh,call me a silly foreigner, give me a poke on the shoulder, squeeze mycheeks, throw me up into the air with her strong arms and twirl mearound like the princess young girls believed themselves to be. Butthere was a hidden sharpness to Da Yin, moments when her mask slipped,and something lethal came out like smoke. Now looking back, her mask wasmade of glass.</p><p>“Can I try some?” I asked one afternoon when we were laying on themattress in the middle of the living room. We had exhausted ourafternoon itinerary of doodling, jumping rope, bad karaoke, andexperimenting with expired make up. So there I was, observing the wobblyceiling fan when Da Yin took out a package of Hawthorn berry candy, asugary cylinder of dried fruit cut into thin slices.</p><p>She nodded. “Of course, they don’t have stuff like this in<i>America</i>.”</p><p>There definitely was hawthorn candy in the States. Da Yin always hadwild notions of America. For me, it was just an endless stream ofhomework and dance lessons. Taipei was freedom, away from my mom’s reignover my every second. She was off meeting with college friends,recounting their “rebellious years”, years which she would trydesperately to keep me from entering, but I have inevitably stepped intonow.</p><p>Da Yin peeled off the candy wrapper.  I could feel my eyes widen atDa Yin’s methodical hands, tearing the paper so that it came off into aperfect, fuzzy-edged spiral. The sweet roll of hawthorn and sugartumbled out at once, falling on the mattress with a bounce.</p><p>Without thinking, I reached for it, scooped it up, and swallowed theentire candy.</p><p>Da Yin stood up from the mattress. Her bare feet landed in the narrowstrip of floor that was free from trash. “That was my last piece!”</p><p>I looked at her, not yet grasping the serious situation I hadstumbled into. I blurted out haphazardly, “I’m sorry Da Yin, I wasn’tthinking.”</p><p>Da Yin yanked me by my shirt. My toes still grazed the mattress, butI was suspended in the air, hoisted up like a ragdoll.</p><p>She unclenched my shirt and began moving about the room like an oddGodzilla variant as I stayed in a shocked stillness. Empty bottles werebeing knocked down by her slow pacing and newspapers crunched under hernarrow feet. I could tell she was fuming, but I was unsure how toapproach this version of Da Yin I had never seen before.</p><p>I resorted to bargaining.  “I can tell my mom to buy you more! Arethere different flavors? What kind do you like the most?”</p><p>Da Yin turned to me. She did so slowly, which now in retrospect,seemed cruel to do to a child, to turn to them slowly as they watched onin terror.</p><p>“I bought that candy with my own money!” Da Yin said, each word apunch, and she looked at me, her brows furrowed as if her forehead wasmade of warm wax. She reached out one hand and grabbed my face. At thatmoment, I realized that Da Yin possessed the sharpest nails in theentire world, almond-shaped and filed to perfection.</p><p>“Spit it out!”</p><p>I tried, I really did. Alas, the hawthorn candy was well on its wayto being digested. But Da Yin only squeezed my face harder. I didn’tyell for help. We stayed there. I could hear the clacking of my uncle’scomputer games from out in the hall. Time slowed. What I remember now isan eternity of her big, unmoving mouth, her nails that dug into my stillround cheeks, her stare locking onto mine, a mixture of mischief andsomething insidious permeating her irises. She let go at some point andI instantly crumpled into a ball. I coughed out a weak apology, but shesimply strolled out of the room.</p><p><br></p><p>The next few afternoons I spent rocking on my grandfather’svine-woven chair, thinking about her. Like that chair, which wassecretly rotting from Taiwan’s tenacious humidity, the image of Da Yinturning towards me started to decompose, and its decaying debrispunctuated my every thought. I became obsessed with her sharp nails andlaughing eyes, scared by her rage and power. I was too young to admit tomyself that, after such a blatant transgression, I wanted to go visither again. So I tried to avoid her altogether at family dinners. I vowedto never catch any attention, to scoop rice with expert precision, setdown chopsticks like putting babies to sleep, hoist chairs completelyoff the ground as to prevent any screeching across the floor. But when Isaw her five days later, I was surprised to find that Da Yin’s rage hadvanished like a summer thunderstorm.</p><p>My mom had dragged me to Da Yin’s apartment to be babysat because shecould no longer stand me. I was like a little wraith according to her,ghoulishly haunting each of her day trips and high school reunions,twitching nervously, scratching my mosquito bites, incessantly askingher when the dessert was coming.</p><p>I entered Da Yin’s living room as if the trash scattered about weregrenades, but I was met with a familiar smile and jingle of laughter. Mymother exchanged pleasantries with Da Yin before leaving, her steps downthe stairs lighter now that she was free of me. Da Yin waited a fewminutes before throwing me the biggest smile.</p><p>“Do you want to go play outside?” she asked.</p><p>I was relieved, happy. “Yes!”</p><p>“Ok! I’m sorry but I have to do the laundry and finish my homework,don’t leave the alley, and don’t tell your mom I let you play alone,”said Da Yin wiggling her eyebrows up and down.</p><p>I nodded in earnest and then ran down the stairs, holding in a grin.I was almost unable to contain my excitement of having the old Da Yinback, pushing all my confusion and fear to the deepest part of mystomach.</p><p><br></p><p>Wang Wang was a boy who lived in an apartment that shared the samealleyway as Da Yin. He had chubby cheeks and spiky black hair thatsprung from his perfectly round head. Every time I saw him, he wassweating — fat droplets rolling down the sides of his forehead, hisbouncy tan skin twinkling in the sun. We became friends the waychildhood friends are made: him showing me his collection of toyairplanes and me showing him the assorted pins on my turquoise backpack.Wang Wang and I would spend afternoons with chalk in one hand and peeledlychee in the other, rainbow dust and fruit juices creeping down ourwrists.</p><p>On that day, we saw who could sprint down the alleyway fastest, andafterwards Wang Wang invited me into his apartment as we were leaningagainst the apartments’ browned bricks, our muscles atrophied from thatchildlike bullishness that pushed the body beyond its pain signals. Ihad wondered aloud about what his home looked like before, so I guessthis was just the natural progression of our friendship.  Wang Wangrevealed to me on our walk up that he lived with his mom who was thehired help for a single dad and his daughter.  We came up the finalflight of stairs and were faced with a tall white door with a pin pad.Wang Wang entered a code and the door unlocked with a clack.</p><p>“It’s so bright! Like out of a magazine,” I marveled as we gingerlycarried our shoes from the foyer to Wang Wang and his mother’s allottedroom. The apartment was in pristine shape. Every surface wasmicroscopically clean and the air was thick with the smell of citrusflavored disinfectant.</p><p>“Yeah, don’t touch anything,” Wang Wang warned. A grey severity hadpassed over his brows and he moved through the hall like a ghost passingover into the next life. I pursed my lips and followed suit.</p><p>The apartment was a long L shape, equipped with big windows and tiledfloors. Maybe it was because I was just in Da Yin’s apartment, but I wasmystified by the dichotomy between the two homes separated by only twowalls and an alleyway. We padded along, and the floor lowered from atiled ledge to wood paneling that seemed older than the rest of theapartment. This was where Wang Wang stayed with his mother.</p><p>“The girl who lives here, her name is Pei Er,” Wang Wang said,closing the door at the end of the hall. “She’s sick.”</p><p>“What do you mean?” I inquired while looking around. Wang Wang livedin a shoebox with a window so narrow that the phrase “a sliver of glass”would be better fit to describe it. A knife’s edge of afternoon goldlanded onto the one mattress where he sat, and it made his hair looklike it was on fire. The rest of the room was occupied by two plasticboxes of clothes and a shelf stacked with schoolbooks and cannedfood.</p><p>Wang Wang leaned in. I braced myself for what he was about todivulge. “The world is poisonous to her.”</p><p>I found myself confused.</p><p>“She can’t eat most things, not even bananas,” Wang Wang explained.“She can’t even leave the house unless my Ma or her Ba goes with her. Hetook her to Disney world last year, and this place called Singapore,”Wang Wang said as if reciting an oral tradition. He lifted his hands asif holding a small box. “But when they travel, they have to bring awhole case of pills.”</p><p>I nodded. “So that’s why her house looks like a hospital.”</p><p>Wang Wang agreed. “Sometimes we play hide and seek, she’s really goodwith words so I let her name my airplanes.” Wang Wang had never let mename his airplanes before.</p><p>“One day I’m going to be a doctor and help her get better,” Wang Wangsaid, bringing a closed fist to his chest. He said this with anearnestness only found in children. I felt something between curiosityand envy sneak up my throat.</p><p>“Where is she? Is she home?” I asked. I had not noticed a trace ofdust or living things when we had entered.</p><p>“She’s in her room. Always sleeping. And my Ma has to nap withher.”</p><p>“Well, if the whole world was poisonous to me, I would sleep all daytoo,” I said, trying to stretch my prepubescent empathy but onlysucceeding at seeming like I did.</p><p>He rolled his eyes and showed me a laminated list his mother had ofall of Pei Er’s allergies. All nuts, milk, wheat, eggs, most fruit,shellfish, the list went on so long I wondered if Pei Er could eatanything at all. I looked out the “window” and noticed that it hadstarted pouring outside. We pulled the one meager curtain closed andmade shadow puppets in the lamplight, telling ourselves stories whilecloaked in artificial light, our imaginations so bizarre and silly weforgot about our mosquito-bitten legs.</p><p>Before leaving, I tried to catch a glimpse of Pei Er through thecrack of a door. But all I could see were Wang Wang’s mother’s tired,sleeping arms. I reckoned Pei Er probably looked sunken andmalnourished, like one of those starving kids on National Geographicmagazines.</p><p><br></p><p>I got back to Da Yin’s apartment before dinner. She decided that wewere going to walk back to my grandparents’ house for a free meal sinceshe was too tired to cook. At a crosswalk, I told Da Yin about Pei Er’scontroversial existence as a final peace offering. I knew that she wouldlove it; Da Yin handled gossip like dough: kneading and molding it,waiting for it to rise with suspense between her fingers before lickingits golden crust with her own embellishments.</p><p>“That’s so unfortunate,” she said, jutting out her right hip andresting her manicured hand on it.  “So she can’t even eat a hardboiledegg?”</p><p>“Yeah,” I said, all chipper. Pei Er was just a character in my head,a sickly, mythical beast. All that had mattered was the glint in DaYin’s now-interested eyes.</p><p>“You know, I think you should try to be friends with her,” Da Yinsuggested nonchalantly. “She’s probably lonely.”</p><p>I nodded. I was busy looking at the people passing holding umbrellasof every color, each still adorned with water droplets that sputteredthe red from the traffic lights over the slick black streets. “Yeahmaybe, but she has Wang Wang, he likes her a lot.”</p><p>Da Yin chuckled. She put her hand in my hair, brushing with herfingers and gripping their tangled ends before finally running themthrough completely.</p><p>“But they do have a really pretty apartment. I bet she has nicetoys.” I offered, and then, I began to drone on about how nice Pei Er’shome was, how I couldn’t spot even a pinch of dust. I glanced over, andI swore I saw knuckles tighten, the white of her bones against heralready pale skin. Da Yin clapped her hands together and the smackbrought me back to reality. “Hmmm, yes, I think we should bake her acake! She must not get <i>any</i> good food!”</p><p>“But she can only eat…” I paused; the list of allergens scrolledthrough my brain in a blur. “Water?!” I exclaimed. “Can we make a cakewith just water?”</p><p>Da Yin stared straight ahead as she grabbed my hand to cross thestreet. “We’ll figure something out, that poor, poor girl.”</p><p><br></p><p>The next day I found Da Yin had materialized baking supplies fromrubble, bowls and bags of unnamed ingredients stood erect, proud againstthe slow decay her apartment cursed all its inhabitants with.</p><p>Da Yin was muttering something from the pantry.</p><p>“Mom made me fried taro pancakes with extra sauce for breakfast,” Ioffered this information as if it was interesting. “Did <i>you</i> makesomething Da Yin?”</p><p>Da Yin walked out with a cake-like thing sleeping soundlessly in apan between her hands and multiple damp rags. “Yes, it’s for yourfriend.”</p><p>“Are you sure Da Yin?” I asked. I could hear my own voice carrying anote of higher-pitched distrust.</p><p>“Why not? I made it with special ingredients,” Da Yin replied. Shewinked. I didn’t know how pretty someone could be until I saw her sharplashes flick so effortlessly at me that morning.</p><p>I nodded. But knowing what I know now, I can’t help but conjecturethat I had already grasped what was about to transpire, but I had chosenchildhood innocence, however artificial, over all else.</p><p><br></p><p>I found Wang Wang outside in the alleyway with his airplanecollection nicely lined up on some crates. “Aren’t you scared someone isgoing to steal your planes?” I inquired.</p><p>He looked downcast. Wang Wang had the blackest eyes, the kind whereyou couldn’t tell where the iris ended, and the pupil started. Now theyhad a watery shine that made me want to crouch down and catch theirresidue with my hands.</p><p>“I’m selling them, my Ma said I had to” he said. “I can give you adiscount.</p><p>I examined his collection for the thousandth time. I tried to cheerhim up. “Let’s make a poster! Or I can draw something with chalk?”</p><p>Wang Wang’s eyes suddenly got very itchy, and he started to rub them,so I wrapped my bony arms around him,  our sweaty shirts sticking toeach other, my mosquito bite scabs brushing against his.</p><p>“Da Yin made cake,” I murmured into his ear. “She says it’s for PeiEr, but we can have some too.”</p><p><br></p><p>Wang Wang’s mother was out on her weekly grocery run. Even then Iknew that this was a good thing, that it would make things go easier. Weknocked on Pei Er’s door.</p><p>“Let’s just give her a small piece,” whispered Wang Wang, who wasmaking eye contact with the cake.  He could hardly stop salivating.</p><p>The door opened normally. For some reason I had imagined a dramaticswing accompanied by a slow and dreadful creak.</p><p>“Who are you?” asked the girl who was Pei Er, looking straight atme.</p><p>“I’m Wang Wang’s best friend,” I said, puffing up my chest. “We madeyou a special cake.”</p><p>I lifted the pan for her to examine as I examined her in return. Shelooked completely normal and healthy. She brought her nose gingerly tothe cake, sniffing the yellow loaf.</p><p>“Why is it special?” she asked. “Did my Ba say I can eat it?”</p><p>Wang Wang crossed his arms. “It’s special because you <i>can</i> eatit. Her cousin made sure of it. Da Yin’s a nurse.”</p><p>She wasn’t. I don’t know how Wang Wang came to this conclusion, but Ithink it was because he saw Da Yin measure my temperature once in herstrange, methodical way.</p><p>Pei Er smiled. “It smells delicious!”</p><p>We crowded around the breakfast table, our feet dangling off thehighchairs, looking like a huddle of little adults. Pei Er scooped somecake straight out of the pan with a spoon. It looked perfectly moist,glistening with melted sugar. She stuffed the cake into her mouth.</p><p>“This…” Pei Er paused. She closed her eyes. “Is the best thing I haveever had.”</p><p>Wang Wang gulped, hunger in his eyes. “Can I try some?”</p><p>Pei Er offered him her spoon and he tried some too, his eyes wideningas he chewed. All he could do was nod. I giggled. I grabbed some cakewith my hand. Pei Er followed suit. Before we knew it, the three of uswere covered in cake, smeared with its sugary goodness.</p><p>I still don’t know what happened first. Either Pei Er fell off herchair gripping at her neck, or Wang Wang’s mom came sprinting straightto the kitchen, squeaky clean vegetables wrapped in plastic andStyrofoam flying out of her hands.  All I remember is Pei Er’s faceturning blue, the word “water” escaping her pink mouth. I rememberturning to her and smiling. I could feel my own bizarre ecstasy, myblood boiling. An apparition of Da Yin’s big mouth spreading into a grinappeared and I felt my smile growing wider parallel to hers. I made sureto remain unblinking. Pei Er’s thin voice grew thinner until she lookedlike a fish out of water, her mouth gaping in open air, her smallcontractions slowing into stillness. I remember Wang Wang leaping out ofhis chair and panickily shaking her shoulders, trying to rid her of thepoison we dealt with smiling faces.</p><p>“I’m sorry, please Pei Er,” Wang Wang said through the streams ofmucus running down his face like a freshly thawed mountain stream. “I’msorry, I’m sorry, I’m so sorry.”</p><p>Unlike when I was in Da Yin’s apartment with the candy down mythroat, <i>I</i> was the one with the luxury to gawk. Some time passed,and I felt my voyeurism sliced into two when Wang Wang’s mother shot mea murderous glare. I ran as fast as I could out of the apartment, downthe concrete steps and into the thundering city, where rain shot downlike bullets, bright blue lightning crawling above through the shiftinggreys and blacks of the sky. I ran all the way back to my grandparents’house, where I was interrogated. I returned each probe with a steadyanswer, the monkey in my brain finding itself more civilized than it hadever been.</p><p>What happened with Pei Er or Wang Wang is still a mystery to me, butI still turn over these events in my head like loose soil above acasket, unable to finally bury what could not rest.  I only see Da Yinnow when I scroll through Facebook. She cut her hair at some point,blunt ends now hit her chin — it looked good, the style suited her.Apparently she had given birth to a healthy daughter. She is laughing inall her pictures. But still, the Da Yin steeped in summer rain, the DaYin that brewed my childhood, is imprinted in my mind. I see the slowturning of her head towards me, but I never really see her face becausein its place would always be my own.</p></div></div></body><script>const short_base = 'poison'</script><script src="./d3.v7.min.js"></script><script src="./d3-dispatch@3.js"></script><script src="./d3-quadtree@3.js"></script><script src="./d3-timer@3.js"></script><script src="./d3-force@3.js"></script><script src=script.js></script>
