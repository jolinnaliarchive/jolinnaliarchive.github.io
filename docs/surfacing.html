today.”</p><p>The words fell out of Marnie’s mouth. Nobody was there to pick themoff the ground, thoughts not yet fully formed meant to be digested andnot regurgitated into the open air. She could taste them, thecompulsivity and randomness of her inner monologues, their acidity.Suddenly she felt sick. How funny. She was just at the clinic earlierthat day.</p><p>She traversed a sidewalk soaked in wet leaves, the texture someat-like she thought she was making her way down an unfurled umbilicalcord, air as thick as placenta. She stepped onto an empty transit bus,her head full of the bus’s big tires on the road, black against black.She lurched either way as the bus rolled forward and felt two opposingforces yanking her apart. The first was the long shrieks of the bus’sbreaks as it barely managed to stop at each intersection, and the secondwas the long blades of orange light that slid through the windows, amixture made from the brown of wet leaves and red from the setting sun.The scratches of sound and color filled the crevices of her brain likecold water finding its way through fractal cracks in ice. She was goingto shatter. Thank God her stop was near.</p><p><br></p><p>Marnie got to Webber’s grill ten minutes late. She had left her rooma mess, clothes spilling out of drawers like limp bodies, her red scarfhad been spread out on her bed like a river of blood. <i>All thiscarnage</i>, thought Marnie faced with the plain wooden doors of therestaurant, <i>just to listen to a man talk about himself for twohours</i>. At least he’ll get the bill.</p><p><br></p><p>George was tall. That was Marnie’s first impression. He had on acheckered green sweater which went well with his grey, unremarkableface. The way he spoke was self-congratulatory, with no real intentionof listening to the person he was talking to. He reminded Marnie of thefoxes used in Aesop’s fables used to tell lessons about people whothought they were all that.</p><p>“When can I see you again?” he asked by the end of their meal. Steakshad been devoured, wine consumed, the check gotten and paid for.</p><p>Marnie laughed, reflexively covering her mouth. “I’ll have to checkmy calendar, thanks for dinner.”</p><p>Marnie walked George to his car, where he offered her a ride, but shedeclined. He drove off while she looked on, his red convertible gettingsmaller and smaller on the dimming horizon until it was just atwo-dimensional speck in the distance. She turned away from the road andwalked towards the downtown, crossing a bridge. Grey clouds crossed overa deep purple sky and Marnie thought it looked like a giant blueberrystrudel. She reached her hands out from her pockets, stretching hertendons in the cold. Her hands were painted the same color as the sky, blisters and bruises from a week of dish duty.</p><p>Her phone rang. She checked; it was her mother. She let it run itscourse, but when it finally stopped it was only replaced by a call fromher sister. Marnie let out a small groan, relented, and picked up.</p><p>“Marnie, she’s going crazy. Can you call her?” Emma fumed into thephone.</p><p>“I can’t, I don’t know how to talk to her.” Marnie scratched thebottom edge of the bridge railing with the tip of her boot. She hopedthat she sounded logical, maybe even hurtful.</p><p>“You’re going to have to face her eventually, it’s not safe for you,leaving home like that. Do you have money? I can pay for the bus.” Emmaoffered.</p><p>Marnie shrugged at no one in particular.  She kept toying with thebridge railing, its sharp rust digging into the faux leather of hershoes. Then two words fluttered out of her so fast she heard herself saythem without saying them herself.</p><p>“I’m pregnant.”</p><p>For the first time, Emma paused. Phone static immediately swallowedup the hundred or so miles between the two sisters. A bird flew acrossthe canal and Marnie followed its path with her eyes. She knew that thesun had sunken completely by then because the bird’s feathers had lostall their color. Marnie found it poetic — a silhouette making its wayhome in the dark.</p><p>“Marnie, I don’t know what to say,” said Emma. Marnie silentlylaughed at this confession. “Are you taking care of yourself? Have youeaten today?”</p><p>“Don’t worry about me, I had steak tonight,” Marnie smiled into thephone. Her head was still pounding from the wine.</p><p>“Is it Nick’s?”</p><p>“Well, it’s mine,” replied Marnie.</p><p>Emma let out a tired sigh. She was in her softened state now, andMarnie liked this version of her sister, when she redirected her energyfrom sounding smart to defending against a common threat. Emma had wonevery fight she has gotten in; she always got her way.</p><p>“Marnie, listen to me. Are you listening? I don’t think you are. Butthat doesn’t matter. It doesn’t matter if it’s Nick’s or whoever’s, I’llconvince Mom, she’ll come around.”</p><p>There was another pause. The static came in again with its distantprickling. No birds flew across the canal this time.</p><p>“Please, come home.”</p><p><i>Oh Emma,</i> thought Marnie. <i>I’m never going back, but I can’tbear to say it to your stupid, perfect face. </i>She hung up.</p><p>Marnie sank into herself. To Emma it was all a vague memory. ToMarnie it was a nightmare she woke up from and could never forget. Theslaps dealt, the words fired from a shotgun tongue, the lines drawn withpointed fingers as her own mother compared her two daughters, one herangel, the other one the devil herself.</p><p><br></p><p>She was just a girl walking in the opposite direction that the earthwas spinning, wading through ghosts, her knees determined to get herback to that home-like place. Marnie had resisted the urge to thinkabout him for the entire day, but now the memories escaped likefireflies, coming in and out of illumination as her old teenage synapsesfired, replaying the best summer that ruined her life. She let themfling towards her, and she caught the buzzing visions one by one,crushing each between her fingers.</p><p>The first time she saw Nick was behind the bleachers. The light camein slanted and lit up half of his face. His brown eyes were at odds witheach other, one demure chocolate, the other brazen gold. He likedphilosophy and poetry, things that Marnie stood on the periphery of butnever dared to dive into. He took her pages of half-hazard stories andread them with serious brows and pursed lips. He would look up, smile,and reveal his tongue purpled by his favorite grape candy.</p><p>She hated that the words from his mouth were the kind of thing thatcould save her. Words so ripe like they were derived from nature itself,their odd combination of granularity and chance, something she could notreproduce no matter how hard she tried. She loved the look of him, thatswirl of his brown hair, the odd tapping he did with his pinky at theedge of a counter or desk, his deep green hoodie, that walk full ofschoolboy coolness.</p><p>So she couldn’t even blame herself. That pivotal night when she snuckout of the house, evading her mother and sister’s careful gaze,sprinting to his car obscured by some bushes. They went to a nearby parkand strolled under grinning, silver stars, gagging at the smell of lakewater and then giggling at their exaggerated disgust.</p><p>A stroll led to a kiss, and that led to them in the back of his car,his denim jacket hanging out the window, Marnie’s pajamas on thedashboard. Marnie shook her head, shaking away the summer warmth thatcrept into her cheeks, replacing it with the stinging cold. In the end,cold was all she got from Nick. Here she was, walking up to a boardinghouse three months later, still thinking about him, left with his uneveneyes, her own dissatisfaction.</p><p><br></p><p>The door shut behind her. It was like Marnie’s past in its entiretywas locked away, left in the blasts of cold October air. She was nowconfronted by her room’s stifling warmth, she refused it — this moment.A wave of nausea took over and Marnie bolted for the toilet bowl.</p><p>When all the organic matter that was not each of her clamoring cellswere in the toilet, an emptiness settled into all corners of her body.Her clammy skin stuck to the white tiling of the bathroom, and theyellowing grout imprinted its gridwork onto her palms and the outside ofher legs. Blue from the porthole window above washed over her skin, andwhen she leaned to examine her own throw up, it looked green andalive.</p><p>Like words that bubbled out of her without her permission, thisfeeling that she was all she had came pouring out, melting her vision,and causing her to shake. She slid from her knelt position over thebasin and rested her arm on the ridge of the bathtub, the energy gonefrom her body. Her back curved forward like a willow tree, a sour achewrapped around her throat, and she felt her head droop from her neck.She brought a hand up to her face and buried her eyes.</p><p>There was always something she was gripping, clawing at, fightingwith clenched fists. Maybe that thing was the silence in response to herquestion “What am I without them?” whispered into a gulf as wide as thePacific Ocean. Maybe that thing was the fact her sister loved her somuch yet so incorrectly. Maybe it was because she could not remember hermother saying something nice to her in the past two years. Maybe thatthing was how she had finally been held so tight that she melted out ofexistence completely, but now her existence felt so piercing, and thatexistence was merging in on the existence of another thing inside her.She didn’t know then, but she was just on the brink of what her life wasgoing to be. Not yet though. All she knew now was that letting go wasnot an option. It hurt, this tightly wound posture she maintained, handsof her past pulling at her shoulders, her head cycling between lookingback and facing life’s momentum. She had yet to stand up, but in duetime she would — grab the wrists of the past and yank them forward withher.</p><p>And from the bathroom floor, her grip unyielding, she cried, dropletsand droplets of <i>I want I want I want</i>.</p></div></div></body><script>const short_base = 'surfacing'</script><script src="./d3.v7.min.js"></script><script src="./d3-dispatch@3.js"></script><script src="./d3-quadtree@3.js"></script><script src="./d3-timer@3.js"></script><script src="./d3-force@3.js"></script><script src=script.js></script>
