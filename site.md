# experimental

## a rolling stone gathers no moss
!md: Digital, Blackmagic HD

The creative process, like the scientific process, is full of trial and error. While exploring the inner workings of our biological worlds and imaginative ones, road blocks inevitably arise. So when and where does creativity emerge? Ideas come trickling in, often in moments of connection between people of all walks of life. Like the complex ecological networks that exist around us, one idea feeds into the next, and it’s sometimes hard to tell who inspired who! In her experimental documentary a rolling stone gathers no moss, Jolinna captures the mundane moments when artists engage in collaboration, both in the loose narrative and the form of the film. It’s a symbiotic relationship, the artists in the film provide her with inspiration for the film itself, and the work she documents inspire her own fantastical visions that appear later in the film. She then in turn captures and honors their artistic undertakings, shedding light on their vulnerabilities.

## wreck

# photography

## Rooted
Autumn Samone, in her series of images in _Rooted_, taken by Jolinna Li, creates a tree sculpture with synthetic hair, framing it alongside her body and the ethereal forest floor. Often considered "natural looking", protective hair styles in black communities often use synthetic elements. Through these plays on what is considered "natural", Samone connects the performance that is culturally integral to black identity to her own bodily performance in front of the camera.
