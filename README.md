### how to add stills to film page thing

1. go to `out/media/{normalized short code thing for it}`
	- the 'short code thing' is determined by lower-casing and adding hyphens in between stuff . .
	- more detailedly it is `x.toLowerCase().replace(/[^\w\s]/g, '').replace(/\s+/g, '-')` which lowercases then removes everything that is not letter or whitespace then replaces whitespace with dashes.
	- basically just lowercase everything and remove special characters um or um anyways
2. copy the picture to the location and name it a number (for order)
3. regenerate website

### how to push changes to github

here is history of commands i used

  100  git status // don't need this but useful for seeing what has changed
  101  git add .
  102  git commit -m 'my change'
  103  git push origin main
```

## `./tool.js`

### `./tool.js normalize_stills`
This will rename all stills (which are expected to be `docs/media/<film code thing>/<a number>.<file extension>`) so that the first still is named `1.<file extension>`, the second is named `2.<file extension>`, and so on.

note: you can name stuff with decimals (e.g. `2.2.jpg`) to reorder stuff nicely

### `./tool.js host_local`
runs local web server that hosts `docs/`.

### `./tool.js clean`
deletes files that are currently generated by `./run.sh`
